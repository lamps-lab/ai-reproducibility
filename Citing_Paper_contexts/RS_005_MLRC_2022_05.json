We conduct a series of word prediction experiments in which we manipulate dependency length together with the presence of an attractor noun that acts as a lure. First, we evaluate the overall performance of the existing monolingual and multilingual models for Galician. Secondly, to observe the effects of the training process, we compare the different degrees of achievement of two monolingual BERT models at different training points. We also release their checkpoints and propose an alternative evaluation metric. Our results confirm previous findings by similar works that use the agreement prediction task and provide interesting insights into the number of training steps required by a Transformer model to solve long-distance dependencies.",

                "abstract": "Systems with voice control are an attractive option for increasing technological integration, not only for people with little knowledge on technology or constrained Internet access, but also for people with certain disabilities. In addition, devices based on Alexa or Google Home provide an interesting alternative for interacting with Internet of Things (IoT) devices, but they usually rely on an Internet connection to a cloud server for their full operation. Furthermore, many voice-recognition systems are only available in a limited number of languages, which tend to be those with the highest number of speakers, thus excluding minority-language speakers. To address the previously mentioned issues, this article presents a solution based on Edge Computing and voice commands that carries out offline voice processing and that is able to interact with IoT-based systems. The proposed system performs local speech inference, providing a communication interface with IoT devices in a Bluetooth mesh, all in a fast way and without the need for an Internet connection. In addition, the proposed solution can be adapted easily for voice recognition of languages with few resources. Such a feature is demonstrated with the Galician language, which is spoken by less than 3 million people worldwide. In particular, different Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models based on three of the most popular ASR development frameworks (wav2vec2, DistilHubert, Whisper) were developed to transcribe short speech and to translate it into IoT commands that perform specific home-automation actions. Such models were fine-tuned for Galician with a corpus of approximately 20 hours and were evaluated in static and mobile opportunistic scenarios in terms of accuracy, energy consumption and latency on an embedded platform (that acts as an edge device) and on a cloud server. The obtained results show that inference is performed in less than 2 seconds on a Raspberry Pi 4 for the two smallest models and in less than 500ms on a high-end Android smartphone when processing all data locally with CPU-only inference (i.e., without hardware acceleration or external processing). The results of the transcriptions are accurate enough to be able to use simple text distance algorithms to detect keywords in the speech and perform commands on IoT devices. In particular, a maximum success rate of 92% was achieved for detecting the indicated commands when using models optimized for being executed on embedded devices. For selected home scenarios, command actions were sent via Bluetooth with average response times of up to 113 ms.",

These LTs, widely supported in languages in high demand worldwide, such as English, are also necessary for smaller and less economically powerful languages, as they are a driving force in the democratization of the communities that use them due to their great social and cultural impact. As an example, dialogue systems allow us to communicate with machines in our own language; machine translation increases access to contents in different languages, thus facilitating intercultural relations; and text-to-speech and speech-to-text systems broaden different categories of users\u2019 access to technology. In the case of Galician (co-official language, together with Spanish, in the autonomous region of Galicia, located in northwestern Spain), incorporating the language into state-of-the-art AI applications can not only significantly favor its prestige (a decisive factor in language normalization), but also guarantee citizens\u2019 language rights, reduce social inequality, and narrow the digital divide. This is the main motivation behind the N\u00f3s Project (Proxecto N\u00f3s), which aims to have a significant contribution to the development of LTs in Galician (currently considered a low-resource language) by providing openly licensed resources, tools, and demonstrators in the area of intelligent technologies.",

By extracting coarse features from masked token representations and predicting them by probing models with access to only partial information we can apprehend the variation from \u2018BERT\u2019s point of view\u2019.

We focus on the zero-shot setting of Subtask A and propose two span-based idiomaticity classification methods: MWE span-based classification and idiomatic MWE span prediction-based classification. We use several cross-lingual pre-trained language models (InfoXLM, XLM-R, and others) as our backbone network. Our best-performing system, fine-tuned with the span-based idiomaticity classification, ranked fifth in the zero-shot setting of Subtask A and exhibited a macro F1 score of 0.7466.",

For this purpose, we make use of a word-in-context similarity task. As all experiments are conducted for the Galician language, we created a new Galician evaluation dataset for this specific semantic task. The results show that compositional vectors derived from syntactic approaches based on selectional preferences are competitive with the contextual embeddings derived from neural-based large language models.",
