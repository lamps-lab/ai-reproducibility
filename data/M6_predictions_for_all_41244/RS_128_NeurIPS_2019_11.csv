"Mixup [25] combines random pairs of images and their labels during training, originally aimed at increased performance but it has recently shown to improve the calibration of DNNs [23].",2,positive
"Deep ensemble We train M standard DNNs independently of each other following [13] and combine the predictions as
p(y = k|x, θ) = 1 M M∑ m=1 pm(y = k|x, θm) (5)
Mixup Recently proposed as a simple method by [25] for training better DNNs where two random input samples (xi, xj) and their corresponding labels (yi, yj) are combined using:
x̃ = λxi + (1− λ)xj ỹ = λyi + (1− λ)yj

where λ ∈ [0, 1] determines the mixing ratio of the linear interpolation. λ is drawn from a symmetric Beta distribution Beta(α, α), where α controls the strength of the input interpolation and the label smoothing.",1,neutral
