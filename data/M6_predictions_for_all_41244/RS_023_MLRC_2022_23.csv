"The former approach accounts for changing proportions of subpopulations, relating it to notions of subpopulation fairness [Duchi et al., 2023, Santurkar et al., 2020, Piratla et al., 2021, Martinez et al., 2021].",2,positive

"Given that CGD aims to improve multi-task learning by encouraging update towards common directions of different tasks, we hypothesize that the need for task specialization is diminished here because the tasks are more similar in difficulty (e.g., in KILT, T-REx and zsRE are much easier than HotpotQA).",2,positive
The best performance is obtained by CGD and it is the only multitask optimization method that yields noticeable improvements over the standard multitask model.,2,positive

"• Group distributionally robust optimization and the follow-up algorithms, including, GroupDRO [12] is an online optimization algorithm that dynamically assigns importance weights during training to improve the worst-case performance across all the subpopulations; V-REx [81] is an extension of distributionally robust optimization by conducting robust optimization over a perturbation set of extrapolated domain; CGD [63] assigns importance weights to each subpopulation so that the model could be trained on the direction leading to the largest decrease in average training loss.",1,neutral
"Specifically, similar to previous works [63], [64], [65], instead of directly setting the weight of each sample to be inversely proportional to the sample size of each subpopulation, we empirically set the importance weight wi of each sample as a function of the square root of its training group size √ kgN , where kg and N denote the g-th subpopulation’s proportion and training samples respectively.",1,neutral
