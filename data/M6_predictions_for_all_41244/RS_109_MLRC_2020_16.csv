"(1) Based on the current SOTA sc-RNA-seq explanation workflows, our system combines the first two steps, and reaches a superior performance, which is 5.62% superior to Global Counterfactual Explanation (GCE) [27] and 3.31% superior to ACE [19], measured by the AUROC of the SVM classifier used to compare the target cluster with the rest of the clusters.",2,positive
"We see that when the selected number of genes is small, ACE has a lower redundancy than our work, while GCE has a higher redundancy.",2,positive
"Although ACE‚Äôs workflow is more compact and improved the performance, in terms of the AUROC of the SVM classifier, of selected markers genes by ‚àº 2.8% over its baseline, GCE, the problem of independent optimization (which would be served well by a single optimization function) is not fully realized.",2,positive
"To wrap up, these results indicate that Kratos outshines ACE and GCE in creating a good low-dimension embedding and best cluster assignment.",2,positive
We next applied the differentiation analysis part in ACE toward identifying top-ranked genes for different cell types based on the results of Kratos and of the ACE and GCE pipeline.,2,positive
