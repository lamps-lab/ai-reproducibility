"In the context of mobility on demand, [6] proposes a deep-learning approach to operate a system that considers its equity impacts, while [7] points to similar profit for every driver and also similar rejection rates at every zone (as we do), but using a method that deals only with hundreds of users and tens of zones.",2,positive

"We examine two different categories of related work in the space of algorithmic bias: research examining bias specifically in ridehailing and taxi service pickup rates [12, 31, 32], and research detailing how to ensure the fairness of supervised learning models [24, 28, 29, 51, 69].",2,positive
"ur work does not rely on a user study, and unlike both Ge et al. [32] and Brown [12], our work is the first to provide an analysis on ridehailing trip fare pricing rather than frequency. Raman et al. [51] studied the impact of rider-driver matching policy and redistributing income to reduce forms of inequality in ridehailing. The analysis revealed that policies minimizing the variance of income also m",2,positive

This leads directly to the next thrust of research: Is there a way to select actions that improve long-term fairness? Existing work [6] tries to add variance as a cost to the optimization objective in the ridesharing context.,2,positive
