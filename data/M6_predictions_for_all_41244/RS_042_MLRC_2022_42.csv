"(2022) but in line with Liu et al. (2022), grokking does not occur when both train and test loss improve together without the initial divergence, as shown in many of the figures in this paper, for example Figures 2 and 18. The core issue is that the model has two possible solutions: memorization (with low train loss and high test loss) and a generalization (with low train loss and low test loss). In our case, the Fourier Multiplication Algorithm is the generalization solution. Intuitively, with very little training data, the model will overfit and memorize. With more training data, the model must generalize or suffer poor performance on both train and test loss. Since neural networks have an inductive bias favoring “simpler” solutions, memorization complexity scales with the size of the training set, whereas generalization complexity is constant. The two must cross at some point! Yet, the surprising aspect of grokking is the abrupt shift during training, when the model switches from memorization to generalization. The other component of grokking is phase transitions - the phenomena where models trained on a certain task develop a specific capability fairly rapidly during a brief period of training, as shown for the case of induction heads forming in transformer language models in Olsson et al. (2022) and our results in Appendix D.",2,positive
