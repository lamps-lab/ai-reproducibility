Good examples of this are well parametrized Gibbs samplers which generate new samples using the target’s exact conditional distributions and, consequently, often outperform other Monte Carlo algorithms (e.g., Sect. 3.4).While formany targets these conditional distributions cannot be obtained (nor are good parametrizations known), their (conditional) independence structure is usually obvious [e.g., see Gelman and Hill (2006), Gelman (2006), Koller and Friedman (2009), Hoffman et al.

The latter article is the aforementioned exception: its author defines the estimators in general and refers to them as ‘TMC estimators,’ but does not study them theoretically. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no previous systematic exploration of the estimators (2), their theoretical properties, and uses, a gap we intend to fill here. Furthermore, while in simple situations with fully, or almost-fully, factorized test functions [e.g., those in Tran et al. (2013) or Schmon et al. (2020)] it might be clear to most practitioners that employing a product-form estimator is the right thing to do, it may not be quite so immediately obvious how much of a difference this can make and that, in rather precise ways (cf. Theorems 2 and 4), judiciously using product-form estimators is the best thing one can do within Monte Carlo when tacklingmodelswith known independence structure but unknown conditional distributions (a common situation in practice). We aim to underscore these points through our analysis and examples. Lastly, we remark that product-form estimators are reminiscent of classical product cubature rules (Stroud 1971). These are obtained by taking products of quadrature rules and, consequently, require computing sums over NK points much like for product-form estimators [except for fully, or partially, factorized test functions φ where the cost can be similarly lowered, e.g., p. 24 in Stroud (1971)].",2,positive
