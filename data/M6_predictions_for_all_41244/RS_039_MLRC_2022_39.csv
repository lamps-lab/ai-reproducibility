"The same scalability limits are exhibited by the two state-of-the-art methods on fair IM that do rely on node representation [16, 17], yet learned only from the social connectivity.",1,neutral
"Compared to [16, 17], we revisit IM with fairness under a more flexible formulation, by algorithmic solutions that are applicable to arbitrary sets of sensitive attributes and to large, realistic datasets.",2,positive
"Crosswalk [16] is a randomwalk based graph representation method, which enhances fairness by re-weighting the edges between nodes from different groups.",1,neutral
"The limitations of [16, 17] are threefold: (i) as they exploit the social connectivity, they incur a high computation cost and cannot reasonably scale; in particular, training the adversarial neural network in [17] grows exponentially with the number of users in the social network, (ii) they assume that the probability of diffusion between a pair of nodes is constant and follows the Markovian assumption, and (iii) they are not generic, i.",1,neutral
[29] serves as a seminal work for fairness-aware random walk-based studies [30].,1,neutral
"[21] propose CrossWalk, a method that enhances fairness in graph algorithms by biasing random walks to cross group boundaries.",1,neutral
"[15] developed Crosswalk, the key idea is to bias random walks to cross group boundaries, which enhances fairness.",1,neutral
"To address the fairness issues, most existing works learn a fair node or graph representation by optimizing adjacency matrices [18], [31], adversarial training [8], or fairness-oriented DeepWalk [15], [24].",1,neutral
"First, some works adapt existing unsupervised graph embedding approaches for fairness (Rahman et al., 2019; Khajehnejad et al., 2021), but it is challenging to accommodate all such models.",1,neutral
"Both of these are widely used by the research community to assess the fairness of machine learning models in graph data [1], [8], [11], [13], [16], [24], [44].",1,neutral

"CrossWalk [24]: This method enhances the fairness of various graph algorithms applied to node embeddings, including influence maximization, link prediction, and node classification.",1,neutral
"The first group of research works focuses on the design of an embedding mechanism that would be fair for the sensitive attribute [8], [24], [33].",1,neutral
"Recent studies on the fairness of GNNs and Node2Vec have also reported similar issues [8], [24], [33].",1,neutral
