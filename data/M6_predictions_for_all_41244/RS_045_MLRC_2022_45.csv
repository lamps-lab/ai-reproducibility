"balancing methods, however, improve the overall performance but are usually at the risk of overfitting to the minority classes or the loss of information [52, 36, 20].",0,negative
"These methods have been shown to increase classification accuracy for DNNs and demonstrated their efficacy on long-tailed data [38, 11, 52, 25].",1,neutral
[52] directly exploit pure noise images as tail class samples.,1,neutral
"A recent approach, OPeN [29], adds pure noise images to the original instances from rare classes.",1,neutral
"The multiple normalization module has been explored to improve the generalization of the model in the field of adversarial training (Xie et al., 2020) and insufficient data (Zada et al., 2022).",2,positive
"Recently, several studies have suggested using multiple normalization layers in a parallel manner (Pan et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021; Zada et al., 2022).",1,neutral
"Besides, the core
algorithmic principle of our CBN is different to that of DAR-BN and Auxiliary BN. DAR-BN and Auxiliary BN essentially depends on a main branch to implement the feature normalization for input images.",2,positive
"Targeted at preventing pure noise images from distorting the estimation of the feature distribution, DAR-BN [42] splits the mean and variance variables for normal images and pure noise images.",1,neutral

Existing work focuses on collecting realistic training data [9] and introducing random but realistic noise [10].,2,positive
