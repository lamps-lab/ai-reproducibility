"This inherently poses the question of how we can trust what our neural network has learned if we can not comprehend and infer the representations it has learned? In the context of reward learning, it is especially critical that we can interpret the learned objective—if we can not understand the objective that a robot or AI system has learned, then it is difficult to know if the AI’s behavior will be aligned with human preferences and intent [48, 38, 16].",1,neutral

"Despite the homogeneity, existing works often require human intervention for value alignment [Brown et al., 2021, Yuan et al., 2022].",2,positive
"While human objectives and values can be represented in a variety of ways, reward functions are a common representation in the value alignment setting [10, 16, 20].",1,neutral
Unhackability provides a notion of what it means to be “aligned enough”; Brown et al. (2020b) provide an alternative.,1,neutral

The multiple experts setting has also been studied in [46] but in the context of value alignment verification where the aim is not to recover the reward function but rather verify that the value function of the agent is close to a target value.,1,neutral
"Therefore, it is also critical to determine whether a learned policy is well-aligned with human values [3].",1,neutral
"Also, for the limited observability setting it can be interesting to explore approaches that alleviate the need to query the full policy of the learner [64, 65].",1,neutral

"With the ever-increasing ubiquity of artificial intelligence in real-world usage scenarios, the awareness of the so-called alignment problem (Christian, 2020) is increasing, as is the need to develop novel strategies to measure and verify the alignment of machine learning (ML)/artificial intelligence (AI) systems (Brown et al., 2021) with human values.",2,positive
"In order to approach the challenge, several different natural language processing (NLP) and ML/AI approaches have been previously proposed and tested (Kiesel et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2020; Cortiz, 2021; Brown et al., 2021).",2,positive

I also recently proved sufficient conditions for the construction of sample efficient “drivers tests” for AI systems: tests that efficiently verify that the policy and learned reward function of an AI system are aligned with a human’s values [16].,2,positive
