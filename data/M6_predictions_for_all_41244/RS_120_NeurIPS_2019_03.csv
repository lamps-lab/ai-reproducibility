Implementation Details We implement the proposed ProContEXT using PyTorch and utilize the ViT-base backbone that is pre-trained by MAE [28].,2,positive
"As mentioned in Section 1, we follow a similar approach to the work put forth in [7], where masked autoencoders reconstructed images with large amounts of masking.",2,positive
"Unlike [7], we don’t remove the masked patches from the input to the encoder and provide positional information to the input of the decoder.",2,positive
"Recently, there has been some major breakthroughs in image reconstruction using masked autoencoders [7], where an image can be realistically reconstructed with 90% of it being masked in patches.",1,neutral
"We denote the former as “speech branch” and the latter as “text branch”, where the former can be viewed as a masked autoencoder [28] and the latter is TTS.",1,neutral
"Recently, BEiT[33] and MAE[34] utilized a BERT-style pre-training as part of the visual learner, and they discovered that models are effective at learning semantics with such a scheme.",1,neutral
"Recently, BEiT [33] and MAE [34] utilize a BERT-style pre-training as part of the visual learner, and they discover that models are effective at learning semantics with such a scheme.",1,neutral
"It is worth noting that both DistilHuBERT and FitHuBERT are investigated under the contrained track on the SUPERB benchmark, which might not be able to reflect the potential effect of the distilled model as it does not fully explore the powerful modeling capacity lied in the Transformer encoder and merely treats it as a frozen feature extractor during the whole fine-tuning stage, missing the opportunity to pursue strong but non-linear features [19].",2,positive
"Specifically, we propose an SSL model, MAEEG, inspired by both BENDR and the MAE model proposed in computer vision [He et al., 2022], to compare with BENDR and to broaden our understanding of reconstruction-based SSL for EEG.",2,positive
"While this result may not be intuitive, the same trend was observed in computer vision where masking more of the signal during SSL pretraining could result in better downstream performance [He et al., 2022].",1,neutral
This study was inspired by MAE [1] for an MIM and Bootstrap Your Own Latent [12] (BYOL) as a framework for directly learning la-,2,positive
"Among them, Masked Autoencoders [1] (MAE) have inspired numerous subsequent studies and influenced not only the image domain [2–5] but also the audio domain [6–9].",1,neutral
"While we use the same positional encoding as MAE [1], we tested various masking ratios as discussed in Section 4.",2,positive
"Similar with MAE [15], the decoder of CAAE is only used in pre-training CAAE to perform image reconstruction task.",1,neutral
"As MAE [15] indicates, the design of the decoder architecture can be flexible and independent of the encoder design.",2,positive
"Unlike in [2], the model is trained to reconstruct the full image as a mixture of individual component reconstructions.",2,positive
"In this work, we capitalize in particular on the masked autoencoding of [2] and investigate using it for object-centric learning.",1,neutral
"Then, exactly as in MAE [2], we add a learnable mask token at the positions of the masked tokens and the sine-cosine position embeddings.",1,neutral
"We therefore choose the random masking strategy, exactly as in MAE [2].",1,neutral
"Another example is the object-reasoning-like results seen in the predictions of masked image-modelling frameworks [2, 3].",1,neutral
"Just as in MAE [2], we add fixed sine-cosine postional encodings from [23] to the embeddings of the patches.",1,neutral
Our model has a narrower bottleneck in comparison to MAE [2].,2,positive
"We hypothesize that the object-reasoning-like behaviour demonstrated to appear in the self-supervision task of masked image modelling [2, 3] can be utilized also for explicit object-centric representation learning.",1,neutral
Our broadcasting module takes inspiration both from the MAE decoder [2] and from the spatial broadcast decoder [25] used in several object-learning models [9–14].,2,positive
Our model is inspired by the transformer-based masked autoencoder [2] with modifications to enable end-to-end unsupervised multi-object segmentation and representation learning.,2,positive
"More specifically, we adapt the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) [2] design and modify it to for explicit object-centric representation learning and segmentation.",2,positive
This is in line with recent findings on training transformers that show the effectiveness of supervising multiple output tokens instead of just a single [CLS] token [73].,1,neutral
"PowerBERT is adopted from BERT model [16, 19, 20] to extract the high-dimensional representations from the massive unlabeled data.",1,neutral
[17] used Vision Transformers [7] for masked image inpainting and reconstruction.,1,neutral
"Denoising autoencoders [15] are a recent deep-learning method demonstrated to reconstruct original images from their corrupted versions across a variety of perturbations, from salt-and-pepper noise [16] to image masking [17].",1,neutral
"Similarly, while ViT has been shown to outperform CNNs on large datasets [17], we observe that ViT outputs contain uneven pixelation when decoding the 16 × 16 patch embeddings, resulting in its low SSIM score.",2,positive
"While [55, 8, 23, 5, 20, 10] have adopted CNN as pretraining backbones, recent works [6, 50, 11, 22, 29, 28] have explored Transformers [46] for self-supervised visual learning, demonstrating their superiority over traditional CNN.",1,neutral
"Despite no labels, models trained with self-supervision have outperformed their supervised counterparts on several downstream tasks, such as image classification [19, 55, 8, 23, 9, 5, 20, 10, 6, 50, 11, 22] and object detection [53, 7].",0,negative
