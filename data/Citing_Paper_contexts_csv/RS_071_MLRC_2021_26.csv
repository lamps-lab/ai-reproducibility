"Consequently, learning with label noise has received much attention recently and has been applied to various problems, including image segmentation [33] and entity alignment [35].",,
"While the fullysupervised semantic segmentation methods have some remedy [12, 34], WSSS literature has paid less attention to this",,
"Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) aims to relieve the laborious and expensive process of pixelwise labeling with different types of weak labels including image-level labels [23, 2, 19, 69, 54], points [4], scribbles [59, 36, 56] and bounding boxes [13, 41, 31, 40, 53].",,
"The adopted weak labels include image-level labels [2, 41, 63, 7, 73, 72, 32, 75, 51], scribbles [36], points [4], and bounding boxes [13, 31, 40].",,
"To this end, many weakly-supervised segmentation (WSS) methods are developed to alleviate the annotation burden, including image level [9, 10], bounding box [7,16,20], scribble [13,23] and even points [1,12].",,
"Here, we compare our model with four of the latest weakly supervised models (IRNet [28], Puzzle-CAM [29], SEAM [30], and BABA [31]) for this purpose on the Corsican dataset and the Flame dataset.",,
"There are a large number of false detections in the IRNet, Puzzle-CAM, and SEAM segmentation results, and the right part of the fire point is clearly missed in BABA.",,
"The segmentation profile of the BABA network is also closer to that of GroundTruth, but its treatment of the flame boundary is more ambiguous.",,
"To solve this problem, a common approach is replacing fine-grained annotations with weak labels, such as image-level labels (Wang et al. 2020), scribbles (Lin et al. 2016), points (Bearman et al. 2016), and bounding boxes (Oh, Kim, and Ham

"According to the weak annotations applied for CNN training [10], these approaches can be divided into four main categories: bounding boxes [11], scribbles [12], points [13], and image-level labels [14].",,
"On the other hand, current methods that use point supervision employ strong implicit assumptions on object scale [35, 36] or dataset diversity [20, 37].",,
