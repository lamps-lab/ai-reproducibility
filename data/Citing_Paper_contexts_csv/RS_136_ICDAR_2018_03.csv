"On the other hand, the problem of table structure recognition (TSR) is a lot more challenging and remains a very active area of research, in which many novel machine learning algorithms are being explored [3,4,5,9,11,12,13,14,17,18,21,22].",,
"For the table recognition task, [25] uses KNN to construct a graph and represent text features by encoding character embedding with GRU;[26] constructs a fully-connection graph and set weighted loss to balance between positive and negative samples.",,

"Most previous methods [4, 7, 9, 11, 12] only use the spatial or visual features without considering the textual information of each table cell to recognize the table structure.",,
"Most existing literature [9, 12, 13] on table structure recognition depends on extraction of meta-features from the pdf document or on the optical character recognition (OCR) models to extract low-level layout features from the image.",,

"2, with the success of deep learning, recent deep learning-based table structure recognition approaches can be divided into three categories: 1) identify cell bounding boxes through visual detection and segmentation methods [25, 27, 29, 28, 8]; 2) transform a table image into the markup sequence, such as LaTeX and HTML [10, 2]; and 3) explore the adjacency relation between different table cells [30, 22, 11].",,
