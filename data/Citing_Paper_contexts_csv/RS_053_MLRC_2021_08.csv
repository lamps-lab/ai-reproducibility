"On the other hand, intrinsic XAImethods such as [56] uses additional loss and attention modules during training and utilize this module to compute saliency maps.",,
"According to [12], we update the slot T = 3 times, D is the dimension after the normalization operation, calculate the similarity of each vector by dot product, and then normalize it with sigmoid.",,
"Some other scholars have proposed to use additional modules to explain the working mechanisms inside the model [12], [13], such as the attention mechanism, but the explanatory results obtained in this way are one-sided and it is difficult to explain specifically the area of attention of the network for a specific target.",,

"In this study, we combine an advanced classifier SCOUTER to achieve an automatic and effective discrimination between natural earthquakes and blasts.",,
"We adopt SCOUTER (Li et al., 2021), a classifier based

The SCOUTER based the pre-trained model is trained on the training set for 50 epochs and the performance results are computed on the testing set with the trained model after the last epoch.,,

"[11] propose a slot attentionbased classifier for transparent and accurate classification, offering intuitive interpretation and positive or negative explanations for each category controlled by a tailored loss.",,
"The proposed guided slot attention is conceptually similar to previous methods as it is inspired by previous methods [11, 14, 38].",,
"The resulting 192 object-centric inductive bias and the relative simplicity have allowed for wider adoption and success 193 of slot attention over iDSPN [13, 11, 14, 18], which makes our improvements to SA meaningful.",,
"Different from the post-hoc method that provides explanations after the model training, the intrinsic paradigm [35,36]",,
"In addition, it is possible to generate adversarial masks [1,11] which solely rely on breaking the input features in order to reduce output confidence – which are easier to locate but do not necessarily explain the decisionmaking of visual recognition models.",,
"Later on, sanity check procedures have shown that most of the gradient-based explanation methods are independent of the model predictions and mainly work as edge detectors which greatly undermined their credibility [1,17].",,
"Next, we turn our attention to attribution maps (saliency maps), which is a very popular line of research in explanation but also controversial in that many of the algorithms have shown to be unreliable [1].",,
"In addition, we adopt the method proposed in the literature [9] to visualize the results of all models.",,
"For the feature vectors Fc and Fr from Branch C and Branch R, they not only need to be sent to the classifier [9] to obtain the classification probability pc and pr, but also need to be fed into the auxiliary attention guidance module that guides the model’s attention tendency (See Section III-D) to get Segmentation map p c and p seg r .",,
"Attentive models include attention modules into their structure, making the elements on which the model is focusing more evident [43, 89].",,
"The authors in [69] also employ an iterative attention mechanism to update the slots, where the number of iterations T=3 just like in capsule routing and vanilla slot attention.",,
"Indeed, the evidence for a certain category in SCOUTER can be thought of as its support in capsule networks, i.e. using an attention mechanism to find support in the image that directly correlates to a certain output category.",,
The main difference between SCOUTER and vanilla slot attention is that the slots are now associated to single categories like in capsule networks.,,
"Figure from [70].

"We can think of SCOUTER as a capsule network with restricted inductive biases and fewer parameters, thus

"[26] presents SCOUTER loss, defining how large the attention area should be through the formula:",,
"The slot attention, however, will have a low resolution due to the poor resolution of the DNN’s latent features [26].",,
"The negative explanation is especially informative in classification problems with high similarities between classes, such as in agricultural datasets [26].",,
"Moreover, the negative explanation maps support the model’s classification, particularly during the mature growth stages, where the dissimilarities between species are substantial [26].",,
A comprehensive description of the negative explanation and Equation (2) is provided in the study of [26].,,
