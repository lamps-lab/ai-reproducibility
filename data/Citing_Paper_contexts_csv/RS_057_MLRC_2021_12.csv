"Several slight variations have occurred on the All-But-The-Top algorithm where the top principal components of the last hidden state of LLMs are masked or removed [18, 3, 14, 15, 23].",,
"Second, previous work has demonstrated that the word-level similarity estimates obtained from the vector space of contextualized LMs might be distorted due to the anisotropy of the space (Ethayarajh, 2019; Rajaee and Pilehvar, 2021).",,
"Anisotropic word representations occupy a narrow cone instead of being uniformly distributed in the vector space, resulting in highly positive correlations even for unrelated words, thus negatively impacting the quality of the similarity estimates that can be drawn from the space (Ethayarajh, 2019; Gao et al., 2019; Cai et al., 2021; Rajaee and Pilehvar, 2021).",,
"Some work suggest that the high anisotropy is inherent to, or least a by-product of contextualization [73, 79], Gao et al.",,
"Because of the re-training cost, other light approaches have been presented as a post-processing step (Li et al., 2020; Rajaee and Pilehvar, 2021).",,

"Secondly, Rajaee & Pilehvar (2021a) increased the isotropy by clustering the embeddings and nulling the principal components of each cluster.",,
"Furthermore, Rajaee & Pilehvar (2021b) showed that improving the isotropy, in general, does not immediately result in a better performance for the model.",,
"As mentioned previously, improving the isotropy by itself is not sufficient (Rajaee & Pilehvar, 2021b).",,
"As shown by Rajaee & Pilehvar (2021b), it is not sufficient to only improve the isotropy of the embeddings, as the embeddings need to maintain the semantics required for the downstream task.",,
"More specifically, Rajaee & Pilehvar (2021b) highlighted that the Classification ([CLS]) token representations are much more anisotropic than all representations in the fine-tuned space.",,
"The (Rajaee and Pilehvar, 2021) work demonstrates that isotropic embeddings have a significant improvement in downstream task performance, as they capture more semantic information and reduce noise.",,
"Multiple research efforts have shown that architectures that utilise contextual and non-contextual word representations lack isotropy (i.e anisotropic) (Devlin et al., 2018) (Rajaee and Pilehvar, 2021b)(Rajaee and Pilehvar, 2021a).",,
