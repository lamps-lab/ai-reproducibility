"the mainstream methods [1], [5], [6], [18], [68], we also adopt the conventional setting, where no intersection exists in train and test set split.",,
"Accordingly, several works [24], [25] based on graph structure construct various losses to capture the relations in the pairs [18].",,
"The proposed method can be seamlessly implanted into different kinds of deep metric learning models, which are represented here by three works including SCT [5], HDML [6], and HIST [18].",,
The drawbacks of these two types of loss functions were limited to the number of classes [2] and not good at leveraging relations among data points [18].,,

"As aforementioned, triplet loss is a seminar example and classical design in this field [18], which has spawned a lot of elegant works.",,
"convergence of these loss functions is not good [18], [19].",,

"For one thing, the pairbased methods [64], [65], [66], [67] can mine rich semantic information from anchor-to-sample relations, but converge slowly due to its high training complexity.",,
"If two embedding nodes are close, their semantic information usually overlaps, they probably have a semantic connection [25].",,
