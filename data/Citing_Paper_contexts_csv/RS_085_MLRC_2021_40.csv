"Similarly, the SOS bias scores measured using the NCSP metric in the inspected static word embeddings, are limited to the used word lists, and even if I use two different swear word lists and identity terms that are coherent according to (Antoniak and Mimno, 2021), using other word lists may give different results.",,

"Biased opinions arise from differing attitudes toward different groups, and in the biased expression, dominant and marginalized groups are usually assigned different attribute tags [5, 11, 18].",,
"Aside from exploring at the linguistic level [5, 18, 93, 94], some works investigate stereotypes and biases against different groups based on supervised datasets related to gender, race, religion, and immigrants [11, 120], aiming to develop more robust detectors and fairer generation models.",,
