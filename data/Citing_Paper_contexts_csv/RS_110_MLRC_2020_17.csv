We create synthetic data to evaluate model performance using the same generating mechanism and mode of analysis as in previous in works on nonlinear ICA (Hyvärinen & Morioka, 2016; Hyvarinen et al., 2019; Khemakhem et al., 2020a; Sorrenson et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Khemakhem et al., 2020b).",,
