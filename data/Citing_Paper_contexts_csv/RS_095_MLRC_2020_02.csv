"Object pose estimation has shown significant progress recently, based on different techniques, such as direct pose regression [56, 7, 26], 2D reprojection regression [44, 42, 18, 19, 40], 3D keypoint prediction [30, 41, 49, 11], and differentiable PnP solver [27, 17, 2, 3].",,

"The camera pose estimation method is improved by adopting simplified constraint equations [14] or reducing the corresponding parameters [15], more recently using end-to-end probabilistic methods [13], [16], [17].",,
"On the other hand, some recent methods try to make the PnP solvers differentiable [4, 5, 17].",,
"Instead of direct estimation, correspondence guided methods [48, 54, 64, 44, 22, 49, 21, 23, 77, 46, 38, 71, 10, 61] follow a two-stage framework: they first predict a set of correspondences between 3D object frame coordinates and 2D image plane coordinates, and then recover the pose from the 3D-2D correspondences with a PnP algorithm [32, 30, 11, 69, 6].",,

[6] observe that the gradient of the optimal pose can be calculated by applying the implicit function theorem [26] around the optimal solution.,,
"Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, all of these differentiable PnP layers have a common property: They first solve the PnP problem to obtain either the pose [3, 4, 6] or the posterior pose distribution [7], and then compute the error to be backpropagated based on a dedicated loss funcar X iv :2 30 3.",,
"To enable end-to-end training, several attempts have been made to incorporate the PnP solver as a differentiable network layer [3, 4, 6].",,
"We also compare our loss function with the state-of-the-art differentiable PnP methods, namely, BPnP [6] and EPro-PnP [7].",,
"The LC loss yields 99.9% gradient correctness, generating the most dilated maps; EPro-PnP produces less dilated maps, and BPnP with about 70% correctness generates the least dilation.",,

BPnP [2] considers the optimization as a layer and enables the backpropagation of network as a whole with the help of the implicit theorem.,,
We also design a unique training scheme for this network by introducing a Back-propagated PnP (BPnP) layer [2] so that reprojection error can be adopted as the loss function.,,
"We employ reprojection error as loss function which is enabled by building on the recent progress on the PnP [1], [2], [28] problem.",,

"Since the optimal so-lution T c ∗ b is a local minimum for the objective function O ( o , p , T cb , K ) , a stationary constraint of the optimization process can be constructed by taking the first order derivative of the objective function with respect to T cb : Following [5], we construct a constrain function F to employ the implicit function theorem: Substituting the Eq.",,
"Inspired by [5], the implicit function theorem [25] is applied to obtain the gradient through implicit differentiation.",,
"We used the EPnP [28] implementation from Pytorch3D [44], since we found it to be faster and more stable than the methods based on declarative layers [8, 16].",,
"Then, we employ the backpropagatable PnP algorithm from [5] to retrieve the estimated rotation matrix R pnp and translation vector t i pnp.",,
"The loss has an additional regularisation term, comparing pest with ppnp, to ensure convergence of the estimated key-point coordinates the desired positions [5].",,
"The formal description is: given coordinates of n 3D points p in world coordinate system C and their corresponding coordinates p in pixel coordinate system C , PnP wants to search the pose (rotation R, and translation t) of camera in C [47].",,
"Recent trends replace the classical solver with trainable versions [4, 6, 20, 43, 50] to infer the 6D pose directly from the intermediate geometric correspondences.",,
"Recent object pose estimation research trends recognize those shortcomings and partially alleviate them by directly regressing the 6D pose from the intermediate pose correspondences to achieve tremendous results [4, 6, 20, 50].",,
"Recently, a similar idea has been proposed to solve the perspective-n-points (PnP) problem [14], but we focus more on the solution to the point-to-plane registration problem defined as constrained error minimization.",,
The previous study [14] proposed a similar implicit gradient to ours for the PnP problem and calculated the gradient of a camera pose in SE(3) based on the 6 DoF axis-angle representation of the rigid transformation.,,

"One type of keypoint parameterization is object coordinates [3,6,26,29].",,
"Another approach is to impose geometric knowledge in the form of implicit or declarative layers [5, 6].",,

"By differentiating the PnP operation, Brachmann and Rother [4] propose a dense correspondence network where 3D points are learnable, BPnP [10] predicts 2D keypoint locations, and BlindPnP [7] learns the corresponding weight matrix given a set of unordered 2D/3D points.",,

"It is worth noting that this regularization loss is very similar to the loss function derived from implicit differentiation [7, 10], and it can be used for training pose refinement networks within a limited scope [20].",,

"Comparison to Implicit Differentiation Method Existing work on end-to-end PnP [7,10] derives a single solution of a particular solver y∗ = PnP(X) via implicit function theorem [16].",,
