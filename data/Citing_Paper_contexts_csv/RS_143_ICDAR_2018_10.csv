"In 2014, a multistage pipeline named Multi-TypeTD-TSR is proposed for table recognition [4].",,
â€¢ Multi-Type-TD-TSR [4]:- It is a multi-staged pipeline for Table Detection (TD) and Table Structure Recognition (TSR).,,
"Different models have been proposed to date, which have been quite successful in localizing the tables between text and images like CDeC-Net (Composite Deformable Cascade Network) [3], Multi-TypeTD-TSR [4] and CascadeTabNet [5].",,
"CascadeTabNet [1], and Multi-Type-TD-TSR [2] are two table recognition CNN-based methods.",,
"Other research studies use CNN-based methods [2],",,
"In [2] and [1], the authors use erosion and dilation, an image morphology-based method, to create a mask of table borders.",,
"Ref [2] uses erosion and dilation, a traditional image morphology method, to create a mask of table borders, thereby solving the reconstruction problem of bordered tables.",,
We compared with morphology-based methods using in [2],,
"Only 2 papers [13, 16] were identified as conditionally replicable on a similar dataset, and none of the papers was identified as replicable with respect to the new dataset.",,

"The results shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4 indicate that none of the 4 methods that allow inference on custom data [13, 17, 16, 31] was replicable with respect to the GenTSR dataset, under a threshold of 10% absolute F1-score.",,
"Recently, several end-to-end solutions based on neural networks have been proposed [13, 16, 17].",,
"Reference [3] uses different conventional algorithms to solve multiple types of table structure recognition, but requires many preprocessing operations.",,
"Types of tables based on how they utilize borders: a) tables without borders, b) tables with partial borders, c) tables with borders [16]",,
"Although the introduction of optical character recognition technologies mostly solved the task of converting human-readable characters from images into machine-readable characters, the task of extracting table semantics has been less focused on over the years [16].",,
