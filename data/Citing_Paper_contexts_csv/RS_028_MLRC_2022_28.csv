Recently (Salvador et al. 2021) followed a similar approach of slicing datasets and identified sensitive subgroups through clustering of image features and calibrated a face verification model on the FPR incurred on these subgroups.,,
"While more and more face recognition algorithms are used in everyday life, many of them have much higher false positive rates for non-white faces than white faces, which would affect judicial fairness (Salvador et al. 2021).",,
[156] introduced a conditional calibration method for fair face veriication.,,
"Salvador, [166] proposes a Fairness Calibration (FairCal) method that applies the K-means algorithm to the image feature representation vectors Z and makes partitions of the embedding space",,
Another line of approaches (Dhar et al. 2021; Salvador et al. 2022) attempts to remove bias from a pre-trained face recognition model by building a fairer decision system: PASS (Dhar et al.,,
FairCal (Salvador et al. 2022) proposed to post-calibrate the verification score between each pair of images in the testing dataset.,,
"There are two possible alternatives to this approach:
(i) Prompting prepends or alters the model input with specific triggers that stimulate a bias-free result; (ii) Vector-Space Manipulation manipulates the embedding space to remove undesired biases.",,

[174] rely on clustering and embeddings to fix unfairness issues in the visual domain.,,
"Other approaches accomplish that by training a post-hoc classifier in an adversarial manner [14], clustering the embedding space [47] or employing conditional calibration [44].",,
"Treatments against bias were applied in pre-processing, by modifying input data, in-processing, by constraining model training, and post-processing, by calibrating thresholds [23].",,
