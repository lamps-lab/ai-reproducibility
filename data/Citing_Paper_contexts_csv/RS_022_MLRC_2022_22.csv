"â€¦the learning of latent representations from the data space that were widely adopted in interpretable machine learning (Molnar 2022; Zhang et al. 2021) and had extensive applications in computer vision (Li et al. 2018; Chen et al. 2019; Nauta, Van Bree, and Seifert 2021; Keswani et al. 2022).",,
"Prototype-based interpretable models also include Proto2Proto [24], ProtoTree [25], TesNet [26] and Deformable ProtoPNet [27].",,
"In addition, Proto2Proto and ProtoTree do not improve the quality of prototype generation compared with ProtoPNet, and their accuracy is only compared individually.",,
5 (bb); Proto2Proto [24]: 84 (full); TesNet* [26]: 93.,,
Proto2Proto uses model distillation to transfer the prototype knowledge of a large model to a relatively small model.,,
"Therefore, we introduce an additional regularization cost LIR (see Figure 3), inspired by [39], that minimizes the changes in the similarities for the prototypical parts of the previous tasks.",,
"Other methods consider hierarchical classification with prototypes [33], prototypical part transformation [47], and knowledge distillation techniques from prototypes [39].",,
"Other methods consider hierarchical classification with prototypes [30], prototypical part transformation from the latent space to data space [41], and knowledge distillation technique from prototypes [36].",,
Combining model approximation methods with sample-based models can balance model performance and interpretability [33].,,
"Many follow-up studies extend ProtoPNet to medical image processing, explanatory debugging, etc [2, 12, 17, 25, 31, 38].",,
