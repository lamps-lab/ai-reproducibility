"Notice that in [30], it uses the deep neural network to learn a data-adaptive reference so that algorithm proposed can perform better.",,
"[18] uses supervised learning with pairs of data {bi,xi} to train an end-to-end neural network (NN) that represents an implicit prior.",,
"The supervised methods (Rivenson et al. 2018; Işıl, Oktem, and Koç 2019; Naimipour, Khobahi, and Soltanalian 2020; Hyder, Cai, and Asif 2020; Zhang et al. 2021a; Shi and Lian 2022) train an end-to-end NN over a paired dataset.",,
"This limitation gives rise to inverse problems such as phaseretrieval [22, 51, 53, 15, 50] ptychography [37, 8], Fourier ptychography [41, 47, 40, 56, 16], coded diffraction imaging [2] and holography.",,
"On the other hand, there is active research on replacing optimization steps and further enhancing optimization routines with learned-references [14].",,
"Affine phase retrieval arises in holography [2, 17]/phase retrieval with reference signal [1,12,13], phase retrieval with background information [8,23].",,
[5] showed that such a reference can be learned from a rather small dataset using an unrolled gradient descent algorithm.,,
[5] is a gradient descent method that requires extensive parameter tuning of its step size.,,
"In our recent work [21], we used the idea of unrolled network to solve phase retrieval problem from the holographic measurements.",,
"Examples of unrolling algorithms into feedforward networks include image deblurring [16], phase retrieval [17], channel estimation [18], and clutter suppression in ultrasound [19].",,
"In [27], an unrolled network is introduced for a Fourier phase retrieval problem with a reference signal.",,
"3) Current deep learning based approaches for PR rely on supervised learning with a large amount of training examples [21, 14, 9, 13].",,
"To achieve this goal, three major problems should be carefully considered: 1) Existing DNNbased methods solve the PR problems by directly mapping observed amplitude to desirable phase [21, 14, 9, 13], in which the physics characterizing the imaging processes is ignored.",,
"[9] propose to learn a reference signal by using a small number of training images, which is further used to assist solving the Fourier phase retrieval problem by an unrolled network from gradient descent.",,
"The above affine phase retrieval problem arises in holography [41], data separation [24, 43], phaseless sampling [20], phase retrieval with background information [25, 56], and phase retrieval with reference signal [3, 5, 6, 36, 37].",,
"Recently, various forms of deep learning approaches have been investigated as a fast and effective approach for phase retrieval [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33].",,
"In the first category, a pretrained network is employed as a regularization or prior for the reconstruction [25], [26], [30].",,
"In [30], the reference provided by the trained network was exploited as a prior during the reconstruction process.",,
[8] assumed that a known reference is added to the signal before capturing the measurements.,,
"Also, the inherent ambiguities about shift and flip in the Fourier measurements make PR very difficult [8].",,
"This leads to inverse problems such as phase-retrieval [13,45,47], ptychography [31], Fourier ptychography [33, 41], and quantitative phase microscopy.",,
