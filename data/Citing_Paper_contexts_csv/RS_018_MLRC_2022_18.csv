"” The sources of unfairness are many, including data sampling bias or under-representation [16, 70, 15, 7], data labeling bias [60, 65, 26], model architecture (or feature representation) [2, 47, 68, 56, 66, 39, 55, 41], distribution shift [23, 17, 50, 27] etc.",,
"Within the domain of algorithmic fairness, our work is related to recent investigations into the effects of distribution shift, or data mismeasurement, on fair learning [17, 33, 37, 38].",,
"For software properties such as fairness [3], [7], [8], [14], [22] and safety [52], complementary approaches provide high-confidence, probabilistic guarantees based on statistical tests and confidence bounds [2], [16], [21], [31], [52].",,

"Probabilistic verification has successfully provided guarantees for such properties for machine learning systems [27, 57, 89, 96].",,
"There are some works [Rezaei et al., 2021, Schrouff et al., 2022, An et al., 2022, Singh et al., 2021, Giguere et al., 2022] that aim to solve fairness under various distribution shifts.",,
"The ability to measure the stability of chosen fairness metrics across dynamically specified bias factors can be a great first step towards safe deployment of fair classifiers, similar to recent works like Shifty [30].",,
"Recent works have studied fair classification subject to these distribution shifts and proposed solutions under reasonable assumptions on the data distribution [10, 12, 18, 19, 21, 30, 43, 54, 57, 59].",,
"The above assumptions are used in the theoretical analyses of the previous works (Maity et al., 2021; Giguere et al., 2022).",,

"6, we add a new baseline called Shifty (Giguere et al., 2022), which focuses on the distribution shift most relevant to ours.",,
"Our framework thus works best when the x distribution does not change, but does not strictly require this condition unlike other previous works on fairness under different types of shifts (Maity et al., 2021; Giguere et al., 2022).",,
"• Similarly, the demographic shift (Giguere et al., 2022) assumes that the joint probabilities of x and y on the training and deployment distributions are identical (i.",,
Shifty first trains candidate models on the training data and selects only the models showing high fairness in the shifted deployment data.,,
"To give a favorable condition to Shifty, we assume that Shifty knows the exact test distribution.",,
"Fairness-specific shifts (Maity et al., 2021; An et al., 2022; Giguere et al., 2022; Schrouff et al., 2022) handle group (z) changes, as z is especially correlated with fair training.",,
"Another study (Giguere et al., 2022) designs a new test method to serve a fair model under another distribution change called demographic shifts, where the subgroup distribution may change – see an empirical comparison with our work in Sec.",,
"• Similarly, the demographic shift (Giguere et al., 2022) assumes that the joint probabilities of x and y on the training and deployment distributions are identical (i.e., Prtrain(x = x, y = y|z = z) = Prtest(x = x, y = y|z = z)).",,
"As a result, both ours and Shifty improve the fairness of the in-processing-only baseline, but ours shows better fairness than Shifty while achieving similar or higher accuracy.",,
"Table 9 shows the accuracy and fairness performances of the in-processing-only baseline FairBatch, Shifty, and our framework w.r.t. a single metric (DP) and multiple metrics (DP & EO) in the synthetic and COMPAS datasets used in Tables 1 and 2.",,
"Robust fairness is also well studied (Mehrotra & Vishnoi, 2022; Ma et al., 2022; Chai & Wang, 2022; An et al., 2022; Giguere et al., 2022; Jiang et al., 2023), such as under distribution shift and with limited sensitive attributes.",,

"It is widely recognized in the literature that learning a fair classifier without any auxiliary information about the target distribution or the data collection process is practically impossible [18, 22, 30, 71, 81].",,

"We would like to note that the procedure that first chooses a candidate set of tuning parameters and then selects the best one has been commonly used in machine learning, such as in Seldonian algorithm framework to control safety and fairness [43, 21, 48], the Learn then Test framework for risk control [3], and in high-dimensional statistics [47].",,
"Indeed, those works define an upper-bound of the generalisation loss of either the error [28, 119], the fairness guarantees [98, 41] or both [72] characterised by the training loss and/or unfairness, model complexity and confidence.",,
