"This inherently poses the question of how we can trust what our neural network has learned if we can not comprehend and infer the representations it has learned? In the context of reward learning, it is especially critical that we can interpret the learned objective—if we can not understand the objective that a robot or AI system has learned, then it is difficult to know if the AI’s behavior will be aligned with human preferences and intent [48, 38, 16].",,

"Despite the homogeneity, existing works often require human intervention for value alignment [Brown et al., 2021, Yuan et al., 2022].",,
"While human objectives and values can be represented in a variety of ways, reward functions are a common representation in the value alignment setting [10, 16, 20].",,
Unhackability provides a notion of what it means to be “aligned enough”; Brown et al. (2020b) provide an alternative.,,
"Proponents of such approaches have emphasized the importance of learning a reward model in order to exceed human performance and generalize to new settings (Brown et al., 2020a; Leike et al., 2018).",,

The multiple experts setting has also been studied in [46] but in the context of value alignment verification where the aim is not to recover the reward function but rather verify that the value function of the agent is close to a target value.,,
"Therefore, it is also critical to determine whether a learned policy is well-aligned with human values [3].",,
"Also, for the limited observability setting it can be interesting to explore approaches that alleviate the need to query the full policy of the learner [64, 65].",,
"cent work focused on value alignment verification (VAV) with a minimum number of queries [8], our work differs in that: (1) we use human feedback in the form of",,
"[8] introduced an approach to verify the agent’s value or policy, but it does not amend the reward if it is misaligned.",,
"With the ever-increasing ubiquity of artificial intelligence in real-world usage scenarios, the awareness of the so-called alignment problem (Christian, 2020) is increasing, as is the need to develop novel strategies to measure and verify the alignment of machine learning (ML)/artificial intelligence (AI) systems (Brown et al., 2021) with human values.",,
"In order to approach the challenge, several different natural language processing (NLP) and ML/AI approaches have been previously proposed and tested (Kiesel et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2020; Cortiz, 2021; Brown et al., 2021).",,

"While there exists prior work [33, 5] on training value-aligned learning agents that learn to respect different reward models, they do not consider the differences in the domain dynamics.",,

I also recently proved sufficient conditions for the construction of sample efficient “drivers tests” for AI systems: tests that efficiently verify that the policy and learned reward function of an AI system are aligned with a human’s values [16].,,

"Within the context of AI communities, some have defined “safety” as the prevention of failures due to accidents [3, 35], while others refer to the field of Alignment, aiming to steer AI systems toward human-oriented values and goals [23, 8].",,
