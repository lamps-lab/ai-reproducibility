"Additionally, preliminary evidence for LT transferability has been provided in both natural and non-natural image domains [38, 45].",,
"On the other hand, lottery tickets have been shown to possess generalization properties that allow for their reuse across similar tasks, thus reducing the computational cost of finding dataset-dependent sparse sub-networks [38, 45].",,
