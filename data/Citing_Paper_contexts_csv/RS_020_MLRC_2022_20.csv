"According to stakeholders considered in the algorithm, there are user-side fairness [15], item-side fairness [14, 20], and two-sided fairness [35, 36].",,
"Compared to some fairness-aware studies [19, 35, 36], although they can also achieve systemic group exposure regulation, they do not take userlevel calibration into consideration.",,
"Recommender systems are known to suffer from exposure bias; few items are over-exposed in the recommendation lists, while the majority of other items are under-exposed [1, 7, 12, 23].",,
"• What metrics and summary statistics usefully capture the distributional efects of a system within a stakeholder class or across stakeholder classes? There are several promising directions here, including the Expected Exposure construct [28] and its multi-sided extension [81] along with positive-sum aggregation of utility across user subgroups [80].",,

"Examples include fairness metrics [15, 39, 44], learning-to-rank applications [34, 40, 45, 46], outlier-aware fair ranking [23, 36], online fair ranking [22], and multi-stakeholder fair recommendation [42].",,

"Other works handle multisided fairness criteria [52, 57] and learning fair stochastic policies via the policy-gradient approach [49, 59].",,
"Since fairness in recommender systems relates to the benefits from multiple stakeholders [144, 154, 155, 156, 157], the request of fairness may come from different sides.",,
"In recent years, fairness has been widely used in many aspects.[3, 8, 11] use different fairness measurement methods to solve the fairness problem of resource allocation in different fields, and have achieved certain results.",,
"In recent years, the question of fairness of exposure attracted a lot of attention, and has been mostly studied in a static ranking setting (Geyik et al., 2019; Beutel et al., 2019; Yang & Stoyanovich, 2017; Singh & Joachims, 2018; Patro et al., 2022; Zehlike et al., 2021; Kletti et al., 2022; Diaz et al., 2020; Do & Usunier, 2022; Wu et al., 2022).",,

"4 Fairness in Recommendation With the increasing attention on the fairness in recommendation [9, 16, 20, 22, 40], there have been numerous attempts to define notions of fairness [19, 30, 33, 35, 47].",,
"For example, if the system presents its recommendation as a static list of people ranked by their expertise on a topic, small differences in estimated expertise may translate into disparately different levels of exposure, as presentation bias causes people to over-prioritize those at the top of the list [7, 30, 34].",,
"This means, for instance, including the interuser equity objective into the loss function [26, 55, 56], sometimes through a regularization term [29, 58].",,
"Reinforcement learning has also been applied to multi-sided fairness, through contextual multi-armed bandits which simultaneously optimize stakeholder utility and fairness objectives (Mehrotra et al., 2020, 2018; Wu et al., 2022).",,
