"Similarly to [10], Salem and Gupta [35] analyze a poset-secretary problem, in which a partially ordered set is revealed sequentially and the goal is to select k-candidates with the highest score.",,
A closely related prophet problem of the online multi-group selection has been studied in [5] and [10].,,
"[10] Jose Correa, Andres Cristi, Paul Duetting, and Ashkan Norouzi-Fard.",,
[10] introduce a multi-color secretary problem.,,
"To tackle this issue, several authors have explored variants of the secretary problem with noisy/biased observations of the ranks [10, 35, 16].",,
"Similar insights are obtained when the distributions are identical; this problem was initially studied by Correa et al. [2019c] and subsequently improved several times [Rubinstein et al., 2020, Correa et al., 2020b, Kaplan et al., 2020, Correa et al., 2020a, 2021b].",,
"Alternative measures of performance have also been proposed to capture the behavior of biased (as opposed to rational) agents [Kleinberg et al., 2021], or to address fairness considerations [Correa et al., 2021a].",,
"While fairness in supervised learning is well-studied (Dwork et al. 2012; Correa et al. 2021; Chikahara et al. 2021; Lee et al. 2021; Mehrabi et al. 2021; Le Quy et al. 2022), fairness in unsupervised learning is still in its formative stages (Deepak et al.",,
