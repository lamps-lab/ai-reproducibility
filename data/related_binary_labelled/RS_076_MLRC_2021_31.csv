"This inherently poses the question of how we can trust what our neural network has learned if we can not comprehend and infer the representations it has learned? In the context of reward learning, it is especially critical that we can interpret the learned objective—if we can not understand the objective that a robot or AI system has learned, then it is difficult to know if the AI’s behavior will be aligned with human preferences and intent [48, 38, 16].",,,0,not_related
