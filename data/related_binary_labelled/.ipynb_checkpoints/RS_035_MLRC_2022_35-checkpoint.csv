"These issues are part of a larger phenomenon of unequal treatment of minoritized groups by technological systems; from algorithm biases making unfair and inaccurate predictions and classification for marginalized groups [5, 27, 28], to racism and bigotry on social media causing these groups to experience heightened harassment, abuse, and mistreatment [40, 47], Black content creators must work around these challenges to succeed in the creator economy.",,,0,not_related
