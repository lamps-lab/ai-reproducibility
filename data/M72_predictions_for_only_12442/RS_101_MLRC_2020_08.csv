"In the field of EGL, we have started to see several works that apply the contrastive objective to the model explanation between similar/dissimilar samples to build up the explanation objective [38, 110, 135, 163].",1,related,1,positive
"What blindspots do we study? We consider blindspots discovered by prior works (Hohman et al., 2019; Sohoni et al., 2020; Singh et al., 2020; Plumb et al., 2022; Singla et al., 2021) as well as novel blindspots (Adebayo et al.",1,related,1,positive

"We hypothesize this would be especially useful for combating background and contextual biases [3, 63].",1,related,0,negative
"To ensure that the pretext task does not encourage contextual biases [17], we only employ augmentations that change the image pixels’ values, but not their locations, such that the semantic content of the two augmented views is identical.",1,related,1,positive
"In a supervised setting, we show that our fair selection algorithm achieves cv value of almost 0, thus reducing the representational bias and improving model performance over the baselines techniques [46, 23, 25, 10, 36].",1,related,1,positive
"In a similar spirit to our work, (Singh et al., 2020) aim to identify and mitigate contextual bias, however, they assume access to the whole training setup and data; which is a limiting factor in practical scenarios.",1,related,0,negative
"These data augmentation or regularization based approaches represent SPIRE’s most direct competition and, as a result, we compare against “Right for the Right Reasons” (RRR) [1], “Quantifying and Controlling the Effects of Context” (QCEC) [3], “Contextual Decomposition Explanation Penalization” (CDEP) [4], “Gradient Supervision” (GS) [5], and the “Feature Splitting” (FS) method from [6] because they all directly apply to image classification.",1,related,1,positive
"We compare SPIRE to RRR [1], QCEC [3], CDEP [4], GS [5], and FS [6] (Section 2).",1,related,1,positive
"However, it is unwanted since we know that such biases may not exist in some final test images (Singh et al. 2020).",1,related,0,negative
"Further mitigation techniques are outside of our scope, but we look to works like Singh et al. (2020); Wang et al. (2019); Agarwal et al. (2020).

"Additional work has used multi-label annotations (Singh et al., 2020), pixel-level annotations (Hendricks et al., 2018), or other annotated features (Kim et al., 2019) to help train debiased models, although these kinds of annotations will not always be available.",1,related,1,positive
