"For the first question, we compare LORE with baselines directly predicting logical locations (Xue, Li, and Tao 2019; Xue et al. 2021).",1,related,1,positive
"First, we compare LORE with models which directly predict logical locations including Res2TIM (Xue, Li, and Tao 2019) and TGRNet (Xue et al. 2021).",1,related,1,positive
"For cell logical location prediction, we compare the proposed method with ReS2TIM [30].",1,related,1,positive
"Because the original dataset does not specify the training and test sets, we use half tables for training and others for test following the setting in [30].",1,related,0,negative
"For cell logical location prediction, we follow the metrics in [30] to calculate the accuracy of four logical indices (i.",1,related,1,positive
"Because ReS2TIM [30] does not contain a cell spatial location module, for a fair comparison, we use the ground truth of cell spatial locations instead.",1,related,1,positive
"Inspired by [26,36], with the annotations of text regions and row/column indices, we can easily generate the aligned bounding box annotations according to the maximum box height/width in each row/column.",1,related,1,positive
