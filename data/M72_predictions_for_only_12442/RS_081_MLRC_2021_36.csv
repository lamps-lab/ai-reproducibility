"Another category exploits the variational auto-encoder (VAE) [21,26,30,41,50] that uses the observed",1,related,1,positive
Trajectron++ [41] uses the observation as the condition to learn a CVAE with the learned discrete latent variable.,1,related,1,positive
We optimize these end-points whose prior is the learned Endpoint VAE.,1,related,1,positive
"The first part of Table V reports simple baselines and the top-3 official submissions on AICrowd made by different works literature [23], [24], [40].",1,related,0,negative
"Since there is no ground truth, to evaluate the prediction plausibility, we employ collision rate because it is widely adopted [34] and parsimonious: regardless of the specific behaviors of agents, they do not penetrate each other in the real world.",1,related,1,positive
"We use same evaluation metrics of previous works [1,17,61,34] for future trajectory prediction.",1,related,1,positive
"Moreover, we also add an augmented version S ′ of the anchor trajectory as a positive sample, following [23], which is created by adding small white noise ε to the bounding box coordinates of the anchor trajectory.",1,related,1,positive
"The parameters of the models are initialized using the weights provided by the authors, except for four models [17, 32, 34, 47] which use weights reproduced from the authors’ source codes.",1,related,0,negative
"We prove that all of the expected values in the generated trajectory distributions with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [6, 13, 17], Conditional Variational Auto-Encoders (CVAEs) [32, 34, 47], and Gaussian methods [39, 49] are biased.",1,related,1,positive
"We evaluate QMC and NPSN sampling methods with representative stochastic pedestrian trajectory prediction models: 1) Gaussian distribution-based model - SocialSTGCNN [39], SGCN [49]; 2) GAN-based model - SocialGAN [13], STGAT [17], Causal-STGAT [6]; 3) CVAEbased model - Trajectron++ [47], PECNet [34], and NCETrajectron++ [32].",1,related,1,positive
"Our NPSN is trained to only control the latent vector samples for the baseline models, and synergizes well with the inference step that comes after both the initial prediction of Trajectron++ and the collision avoidance of NCE.",1,related,1,positive
