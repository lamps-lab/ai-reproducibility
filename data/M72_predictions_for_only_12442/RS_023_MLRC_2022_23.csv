"Given that CGD aims to improve multi-task learning by encouraging update towards common directions of different tasks, we hypothesize that the need for task specialization is diminished here because the tasks are more similar in difficulty (e.g., in KILT, T-REx and zsRE are much easier than HotpotQA).",1,related,1,positive
"The performance of the recent general multitask algorithms, PCG (Yu et al., 2020), CGD (Piratla et al., 2021), and GradNorm (Chen et al., 2018), are obtained from our own implementation.",1,related,1,positive
"To be same as previous works [42], [63] and WILDs leaderboard [75], we report the average accuracy over 10 different random seeds on the Camelyon17 dataset.",1,related,0,negative
"We denote this metric as “Wg Acc”, which is a standard metric when evaluating on datasets with shortcut features (Sagawa et al., 2019; Piratla et al., 2021).",1,related,1,positive
"To be consistent with existing works [33, 56, 70], we report the average accuracy of Camelyon17 over 10 different random seeds.",1,related,0,negative
