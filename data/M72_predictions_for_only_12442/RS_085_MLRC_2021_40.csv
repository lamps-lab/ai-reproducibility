"In this work, we define social bias as the unbalanced disposition (or prejudice) in favor of or against a thing, person or group, relative to another, in a way that is deemed as unfair (Adewumi et al., 2019; Antoniak and Mimno, 2021; Maddox, 2004).",1,related,1,positive
"The lexica are adapted from public sources(4) and may be expanded as the need arises, given that bias terms and attitudes are ever evolving (Antoniak and Mimno, 2021; Haemmerlie and Montgomery, 1991).",1,related,0,negative
"We give concrete examples in Appendix A.
Antoniak and Mimno (2021) argues that the most important variable when exploring biases in word embeddings are not the automatizable parts of the problem but the manual part, that is the word lists used for modelling the type of bias to be explored and the…",1,related,1,positive
"We develop on the insights of Antoniak and Mimno (2021) by facilitating access to these technologies to domain experts with no technical expertise, so that they can provide well-founded word lists, by pouring their knowledge into those lists.",1,related,0,negative
"For this, we reproduced an experiment by Antoniak and Mimno [1] ranking the cosine similarity between the first Principal Component (PC) of the bias subspace and all words in the corpus.",1,related,1,positive

"Furthermore, looking at the official dataset statistics, for example for WikiText [7], it is clear that our reproduced vocabulary size is a lot closer to the ground truth than the one by Antoniak and Mimno [1].",1,related,1,positive
"This reproducibility study focuses on Antoniak and Mimno [1]’s main claim that the rationale for the construction of these lexicons needs thorough checking before usage, as the seeds used for bias measurement can themselves exhibit biases.",1,related,0,negative
"Furthermore, we acknowledge that our analysis of gender associated biases is limited to binary gender and our intrinsic evaluations require discrete categorizations (Dev et al., 2021b; Antoniak and Mimno, 2021).",1,related,1,positive
