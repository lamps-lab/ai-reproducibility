"On the other hand, even if our model and transmitted images can be intercepted by attackers, we can encrypt the CNN model and secret information by encryption algorithms, e.g., Xiang’s [48] and Lee’s [49] algorithms can be utilized to encrypt the CNN models, and the AES and DES algorithms can be used to encrypt secret information, to further improve the security.",1,related,1,positive
