"According to [12], we update the slot T = 3 times, D is the dimension after the normalization operation, calculate the similarity of each vector by dot product, and then normalize it with sigmoid.",1,related,1,positive
"We adopt a slot attention-based mechanism [26, 27] to spot the region in which each concept is found.",1,related,1,positive
"In this study, we use a slot attention-based classifier SCOUTER (Li et al., 2021) to classify natural earthquakes and blasts.",1,related,0,negative
"In this study, we combine an advanced classifier SCOUTER to achieve an automatic and effective discrimination between natural earthquakes and blasts.",1,related,0,negative
"We adopt SCOUTER (Li et al., 2021), a classifier based
on slot attention, which involves the explanation to each category in the final confidence.",1,related,1,positive
"Next, we turn our attention to attribution maps (saliency maps), which is a very popular line of research in explanation but also controversial in that many of the algorithms have shown to be unreliable [1].",1,related,1,positive
"In addition, we adopt the method proposed in the literature [9] to visualize the results of all models.",1,related,1,positive
"For the feature vectors Fc and Fr from Branch C and Branch R, they not only need to be sent to the classifier [9] to obtain the classification probability pc and pr, but also need to be fed into the auxiliary attention guidance module that guides the modelâ€™s attention tendency (See Section III-D) to get Segmentation map p c and p seg r .",1,related,1,positive
"We can think of SCOUTER as a capsule network with restricted inductive biases and fewer parameters, thus

"We adopt a recently-emerged explainable classifier, called SCOUTER [11], and propose a new FSL method, named match-them-up network (MTUNet).",1,related,1,positive
"For pre-training of PE module, we used the same parameter setting as [11].",1,related,1,positive
"To maintain the spatial information, position embedding P [25, 13, 11] is added to the features, i.",1,related,1,positive
