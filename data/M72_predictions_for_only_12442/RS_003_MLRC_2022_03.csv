"Our current work is closely related to previous work by Schwarzschild et al. [2021b] and [Bansal et al., 2022] that propose architectural choices and training mechanisms that enable weight tied networks to generalize on harder problem instances.",1,related,1,positive
"We used the original code released by [Bansal et al., 2022] to replicate the results for weight-tied input-injected networks trained with progressive training.",1,related,0,negative
"For experiments with truncated backpropagation, we follow the exact setting as specified in [Bansal et al., 2022].",1,related,1,positive
"2a we show upward generalization performance using both equilibrium models and progressive nets [Bansal et al., 2022] â€“ and the lack thereof using non-input-injected networks.",1,related,1,positive
