"To investigate the effect of isotropy enhancement for the multilingual embedding space, we opted for our cluster-based approach (Rajaee and Pilehvar, 2021), which is a recent example from the latter category.",1,related,1,positive
"By applying a cluster-based isotropy enhancement method (Rajaee and Pilehvar, 2021), we demonstrate that increasing isotropy of multilingual embedding space can result in significant performance improvements on semantic textual similarity tasks.",1,related,1,positive
"As mentioned previously, improving the isotropy by itself is not sufficient (Rajaee & Pilehvar, 2021b).",1,related,0,negative
"As shown by Rajaee & Pilehvar (2021b), it is not sufficient to only improve the isotropy of the embeddings, as the embeddings need to maintain the semantics required for the downstream task.",1,related,1,positive
"We follow (Mu et al., 2017) (Rajaee and Pilehvar, 2021a) in quantifying isotropy using the metric in 1, and the partition function 2 by (Arora et al., 2016):
I(W ) = minu∈UF (u)
maxu∈UF (u) (1)
F (u) = N∑ i=1 eu Twi (2)

• U : is the set of eigenvectors of the embedding matrix W
• u: is the…",1,related,1,positive

As cited by (Rajaee and Pilehvar, 2021a), (Arora et al., 2016) proved that using a constant for isotropic embedding spaces, F (u) can be…",1,related,1,positive
"We use (Rajaee and Pilehvar, 2021a)’s cluster-based approach in our work to achieve an embedding space with representations homogeneously dispersed.",1,related,1,positive
"To refine MARBERT’s isotropy, we use a clusterbased approach (Rajaee and Pilehvar, 2021a) which builds on top of (Mu et al., 2017) technique to improve isotropy in non-contextual word embeddings.",1,related,1,positive
