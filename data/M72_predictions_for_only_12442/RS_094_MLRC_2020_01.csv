"Further possible candidates are the GCE translations proposed in (Plumb et al., 2020; Ley et al., 2022), and a non-interpretable accumulation of the costs of local CEs, used solely to assess minimum costs per input, and not naively averaged over to produce GCEs.",1,related,0,negative
"…the GLOBE-CE framework recovers minimum cost recourses very close to the theoretical global optima of the SVM.
Model Agnostic Other black box GCE methods that adopt translation based approaches, such as those in Plumb et al. (2020) and Ley et al. (2022), are easily integrated into our framework.",1,related,1,positive

"To generate the simulated sc-RNA-seq dataset, we use the SymSim (Synthetic model of multiple variability factors for Simulation) simulator that explicitly models the data generating processes observed in sc-RNA-seq experiments [43], also used by [19, 27] for their evaluation.",1,related,1,positive
"Also, we compare GCE to Kratos, combined with the different explanation methods, and the Figure 5d indicates that Kratos outperforms, 5.62% on average, relative to GCE within top-1% marker genes.",1,related,0,negative
"(1) Based on the current SOTA sc-RNA-seq explanation workflows, our system combines the first two steps, and reaches a superior performance, which is 5.62% superior to Global Counterfactual Explanation (GCE) [27] and 3.31% superior to ACE [19], measured by the AUROC of the SVM classifier used to compare the target cluster with the rest of the clusters.",1,related,0,negative
"We see that when the selected number of genes is small, ACE has a lower redundancy than our work, while GCE has a higher redundancy.",1,related,0,negative
"To wrap up, these results indicate that Kratos outshines ACE and GCE in creating a good low-dimension embedding and best cluster assignment.",1,related,1,positive
We next applied the differentiation analysis part in ACE toward identifying top-ranked genes for different cell types based on the results of Kratos and of the ACE and GCE pipeline.,1,related,0,negative
"Although drawing inspiration from Transitive Global Translations (TGTs), as proposed by Plumb et al. (2020), our method performs a different operation; instead of learning translations in input space that result in high quality mappings in a lower dimensional latent space, we find that results are…",1,related,1,positive
"To our knowledge, the only exception is the global counterfactual explanation (GCE) algorithm (Plumb et al., 2020) which is motivated by compressed sensing (Candès, 2006).",1,related,1,positive
"To our knowledge, the only exception is the global counterfactual explanation (GCE) algorithm (Plumb et al., 2020), but that algorithm is limited to using a linear transformation.",1,related,1,positive

"The proposed explanatory technique by Plumb et al.

"For the sake of ensuring future reproducibility of the experiments originally presented in (6), as an addition, we have also provided an upgraded version of the original code, without further modifications, which is now compatible with more recent versions of TensorFlow.",1,related,1,positive
"Results The results presented in (6) were reproducible, both by using the provided code and our own implementation.",1,related,0,negative
"The proposed explanatory technique in (6) does exactly this: it reverse-engineers the obtained cluster labels in latent space to label the corresponding data in original space; then ‘tweaks’ an initial cluster by translating the initial cluster in original space, so that it is mapped to (approximately) the same point in latent space.",1,related,1,positive
