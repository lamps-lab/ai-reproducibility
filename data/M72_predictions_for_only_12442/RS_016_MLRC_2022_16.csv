"(2)We also restrict to supervised models, since only early works exist to interpret unsupervised models [48, 49].",1,related,1,positive
"We compared the performance of our likelihood ratio ranking with two other methods designed for interpreting the latent spaces of unsupervised machine learning models: Hotspot [28], a method that ranks genes by spatial autocorrelation when provided a given metric of cell-cell similarity (e.g. the latent space of an autoencoder), and an adaptation of integrated gradients [26] for unsupervised models proposed in Crabbé and van der Schaar [27] applied to multiGroupVI’s group-specific latent spaces.",1,related,1,positive

"We quantitatively compare these various feature importance scores by computing their Pearson correlation r as in [64, 65].",1,related,1,positive
"We do not compare with methods that are not post-hoc, that require exposure to outliers, or are not actionable (most existing XAI methods) to match model monitoring settings.",1,related,0,negative
