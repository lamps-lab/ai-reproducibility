"By incorporating shrinkage using ridge regression [1] as opposed to OLS as the GLM within the MDI+ framework, we are able to mitigate this instability and regain the added benefits of including the raw feature and LOO evaluation, as illustrated by the strong performance of MDI+ (ridge+raw+loo).",1,related,1,positive
"The starting point of our framework is a recently discovered connection between decision trees and linear models [38, 1].",1,related,1,positive
"Finally, we consider Hierarchical Shrinkage [25] (HS)method in its default configuration.",1,related,1,positive
"We consider 4 impelementations of decision tree algorithms, namely XGBoost [9], scikit-learn [11], Generalized Optimized Sparse Decision Tree (GODST) [10], and Hierarchical Shrinkage [1].",1,related,1,positive
