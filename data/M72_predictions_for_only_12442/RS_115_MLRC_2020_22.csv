"We assume a generic model framework and notations [57, 99].",1,related,1,positive
"For regularization methods, we conducted a grid search with parameter grid [0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1, 5, 10] for CONICITY and [0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20] for TYING.",1,related,1,positive
"Taking a step further, we applied two regularization techniques, TYING and CONICITY, originally aimed at increasing faithfulness of attention explanations, with the hypothesis that the issue underpinning disagreements and unfaithfulness is the same – representation entanglement in the hidden space.",1,related,1,positive
"In Table 2 we report correlation scores on the test splits of all datasets for regularized models (CONICITY, TYING) and their unregularized variants (BASE).",1,related,1,positive
"We include the results for all datasets across training epochs for regularized models (CONICITY, TYING) when compared to their unregularized, BASE variants.",1,related,1,positive
"We hypothesize that the cause of saliency method disagreements is rooted in representation entanglement and experimentally show that agreement can be significantly improved by regularization techniques such as tying (Tutek and Šnajder, 2020) and conicity (Mohankumar et al., 2020).",1,related,1,positive
"To counteract this issue, we employ two regularization schemes that have been shown to improve the faithfulness of the attention mechanism as a method of interpretability: CONICITY (Mohankumar et al., 2020) and TYING (Tutek and Šnajder, 2020).",1,related,1,positive
"In addition, we compare against rational-aware models: 1) LSTM-ortho and LSTM-diversity, both proposed in (Mohankumar et al. 2020).",1,related,1,positive
