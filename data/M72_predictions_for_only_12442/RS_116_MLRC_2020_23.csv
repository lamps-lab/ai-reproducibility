"Note that, although we do not use “do” operator to introduce intervention, O’Shaughnessy et al. (2020) shows that I (α→ Y |do (β)) = I (α;Y |β) from the rules of do-calculus.",1,related,1,positive
"Simplifying causal metric for training the selector: We choose RED, which is an information theoretic causal strength measure to train the selector as it satisfies:  It can capture the non-linear, and complex relationship between input and output variables that is common in black-box DL models [30].",1,related,1,positive
We follow an information-theoretical approach to measure the flow of information [18] to quantify faithfulness.,1,related,1,positive
"After localizing the features through the two methods, we perturb the salient features and observe the change in the classifier’s output on these new images, a commonly employed metric [36, 37].",1,related,1,positive
"We are conducting a data collection study to observe the real-world practicality and performance of an adaptive DBS algorithm in patients with PD to observe the resulting LFP dynamics under adaptive DBS in 10 patients (Oyama et al., 2021).",1,related,1,positive
"Next, we compare to O’Shaughnessy et al. (2020), in which we used a VAE model with ten continuous factors and encouraged three factors to have causal effects on predicted classes.",1,related,1,positive
"Inspired by O’Shaughnessy et al. (2020), we employs a generative model to learn the data distribution while encouraging the causal influence of certain latent factors.",1,related,1,positive
"The closest method in spirit to the explanations provided by our StylEx approach is [20], though their method only works on small images, and Figure 3.",1,related,1,positive
