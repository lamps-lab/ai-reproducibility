Surprisingly, we observe a linear correlation between the two latent spaces. This means the self-pretrained encoder and decoder can be frozen, and we only need to learn a linear converter to connect them from the paired seismic data and velocity map. This introduces an interesting insight into FWI: the self-consistent representation within each domain is associated with simpler mapping across domains. We name this method SimFWI, as it simplifies the mapping (linear) in FWI between seismic data and velocity map via domain-independent self-supervised learning. Furthermore, SimFWI provides a better understanding of the relationship among multiple FWI datasets with different subsurface structures. We found that these datasets can share both encoders and decoders, but have different linear mappings between the latent spaces of two domains (i.e. seismic data and velocity map). Essentially, the two domains have a piece-wise linear relationship over multiple datasets. In addition, we found a correlation between the linear layer’s singular values and the complexity of the dataset. SimFWI achieves solid performance on multiple FWI datasets. It has comparable results to the InversionNet Wu & Lin (2019), a jointly trained model that uses paired data as supervision, with only half the model size (12.",1,related,1,positive
