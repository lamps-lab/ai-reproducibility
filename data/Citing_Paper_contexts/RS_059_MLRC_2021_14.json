                "abstract": "Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based applications in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs, or Human-Machine Interfaces, HMIs), diagnosis of neurological disease, rehabilitation, etc, rely on supervised techniques such as EEG classification that requires given class labels or markers. Incomplete or incorrectly labeled or unlabeled EEG data are increasing with the ever-expanding amount of EEG data generated by such applications and the ambiguities these generate degrade the performance of supervised techniques. To address the challenging task of clustering EEG data with limited priori knowledge, we introduce a semi-supervised graph embedding EEG clustering approach termed ConsEEGc with multiple constraints, i.e., label-transformed connectivity constraints that constrains the connection or disconnection among EEG data, compactness-and-scatter constraint that constrains the intra-cluster compactness and inter-cluster scatter of EEG clusters, and fairness constraint that constrains the fair ratio of elements between EEG clusters, to make best use of limited priori knowledge of EEG data and to achieve better EEG clustering results. ConsEEGc is conducted with an optimization objective function that integrates pseudo label learning, least-square error minimization and multiple constraints, and it can quickly converge to local optima. The experiments demonstrate that ConsEEGc can efficiently yield good clustering results on various types of real-world EEG datasets, compared to state-of-the-art standard unsupervised and semi-supervised EEG/time series clustering algorithms.",

In this paper, we consider a fair variant of the partitioning problem wherein nodes are characterized by a categorical sensitive attribute (e.g., gender or race) indicating membership to different demographic groups. Our goal is to ensure that each group is approximately proportionally represented in each cluster while minimizing the normalized cut value. To resolve this problem, we propose a two-phase spectral algorithm called FNM. In the first phase, we add an augmented Lagrangian term based on our fairness criteria to the objective function for obtaining a fairer spectral node embedding. Then, in the second phase, we design a rounding scheme to produce $k$ clusters from the fair embedding that effectively trades off fairness and partition quality. Through comprehensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the superior performance of FNM compared with three baseline methods.",

We propose a Prerequisite-driven Fair Clustering (PDFC ) algorithm to solve this problem. Specifically, we define the structural constraint on the connection among nodes in HINs by combining meta-paths and prerequisite meta-paths and introduce Fairlets as the balance constraint. Under two constraints, we learn node embeddings based on graph models and perform theCholesky decomposition to obtain their orthogonal embeddings. We fuse node embeddings under constraints, define the loss function of PDFC, and perform k-means to achieve clustering. In addition, we design an update strategy of the adjacency matrix to achieve dynamic PDFC over time. Compared with several fair clustering algorithms on three real-world datasets, our experimental results verify the effectiveness and efficiency of PDFC.",

                "abstract": "The study of algorithmic fairness received growing attention recently. This stems from the awareness that bias in the input data for machine learning systems may result in discriminatory outputs. For clustering tasks, one of the most central notions of fairness is the formalization by Chierichetti, Kumar, Lattanzi, and Vassilvitskii [NeurIPS 2017]. A clustering is said to be fair, if each cluster has the same distribution of manifestations of a sensitive attribute as the whole input set. This is motivated by various applications where the objects to be clustered have sensitive attributes that should not be over- or underrepresented. We discuss the applicability of this fairness notion to Correlation Clustering. The existing literature on the resulting Fair Correlation Clustering problem either presents approximation algorithms with poor approximation guarantees or severely limits the possible distributions of the sensitive attribute (often only two manifestations with a 1:1 ratio are considered). Our goal is to understand if there is hope for better results in between these two extremes. To this end, we consider restricted graph classes which allow us to characterize the distributions of sensitive attributes for which this form of fairness is tractable from a complexity point of view. While existing work on Fair Correlation Clustering gives approximation algorithms, we focus on exact solutions and investigate whether there are efficiently solvable instances. The unfair version of Correlation Clustering is trivial on forests, but adding fairness creates a surprisingly rich picture of complexities. We give an overview of the distributions and types of forests where Fair Correlation Clustering turns from tractable to intractable. The most surprising insight to us is the fact that the cause of the hardness of Fair Correlation Clustering is not the strictness of the fairness condition.",

                "abstract": "Clustering is an unsupervised learning task that aims to partition data into a set of clusters. In many applications, these clusters correspond to real-world constructs (e.g. electoral districts) whose benefit can only be attained by groups when they reach a minimum level of representation (e.g. 50\\% to elect their desired candidate). This paper considers the problem of performing k-means clustering while ensuring groups (e.g. demographic groups) have that minimum level of representation in a specified number of clusters. We show that the popular $k$-means algorithm, Lloyd's algorithm, can result in unfair outcomes where certain groups lack sufficient representation past the minimum threshold in a proportional number of clusters. We formulate the problem through a mixed-integer optimization framework and present a variant of Lloyd's algorithm, called MiniReL, that directly incorporates the fairness constraints. We show that incorporating the fairness criteria leads to a NP-Hard sub-problem within Lloyd's algorithm, but we provide computational approaches that make the problem tractable for even large datasets. Numerical results show that the approach is able to create fairer clusters with practically no increase in the k-means clustering cost across standard benchmark datasets.",

                "abstract": "Fair clustering aims to divide data into distinct clusters while preventing sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, race, RNA sequencing technique) from dominating the clustering. Although a number of works have been conducted and achieved huge success recently, most of them are heuristical, and there lacks a unified theory for algorithm design. In this work, we fill this blank by developing a mutual information theory for deep fair clustering and accordingly designing a novel algorithm, dubbed FCMI. In brief, through maximizing and minimizing mutual information, FCMI is designed to achieve four characteristics highly expected by deep fair clustering, i.e., compact, balanced, and fair clusters, as well as informative features. Besides the contributions to theory and algorithm, another contribution of this work is proposing a novel fair clustering metric built upon information theory as well. Unlike existing evaluation metrics, our metric measures the clustering quality and fairness as a whole instead of separate manner. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed FCMI, we conduct experiments on six benchmarks including a single-cell RNA-seq atlas compared with 11 state-of-the-art methods in terms of five metrics.

A large variety of fairness\u2010aware ML solutions have been proposed which involve fairness\u2010related interventions in the data, learning algorithms, and/or model outputs. However, a vital part of proposing new approaches is evaluating them empirically on benchmark datasets that represent realistic and diverse settings. Therefore, in this paper, we overview real\u2010world datasets used for fairness\u2010aware ML. We focus on tabular data as the most common data representation for fairness\u2010aware ML. We start our analysis by identifying relationships between the different attributes, particularly with respect to protected attributes and class attribute, using a Bayesian network. For a deeper understanding of bias in the datasets, we investigate interesting relationships using exploratory analysis.",

                "abstract": "Clustering is a fundamental unsupervised learning problem where a dataset is partitioned into clusters that consist of nearby points in a metric space. A recent variant, fair clustering, associates a color with each point representing its group membership and requires that each color has (approximately) equal representation in each cluster to satisfy group fairness. In this model, the cost of the clustering objective increases due to enforcing fairness in the algorithm. The relative increase in the cost, the ''price of fairness,'' can indeed be unbounded. Therefore, in this paper we propose to treat an upper bound on the clustering objective as a constraint on the clustering problem, and to maximize equality of representation subject to it. We consider two fairness objectives: the group utilitarian objective and the group egalitarian objective, as well as the group leximin objective which generalizes the group egalitarian objective. We derive fundamental lower bounds on the approximation of the utilitarian and egalitarian objectives and introduce algorithms with provable guarantees for them. For the leximin objective we introduce an effective heuristic algorithm. We further derive impossibility results for other natural fairness objectives. We conclude with experimental results on real-world datasets that demonstrate the validity of our algorithms.",

                "abstract": "Within the relatively busy area of fair machine learning that has been dominated by classification fairness research, fairness in clustering has started to see some recent attention. In this position paper, we assess the existing work in fair clustering and observe that there are several directions that are yet to be explored, and postulate that the state-of-the-art in fair clustering has been quite parochial in outlook. We posit that widening the normative principles to target for, characterizing shortfalls where the target cannot be achieved fully, and making use of knowledge of downstream processes can significantly widen the scope of research in fair clustering research. At a time when clustering and unsupervised learning are being increasingly used to make and influence decisions that matter significantly to human lives, we believe that widening the ambit of fair clustering is of immense significance.",

                "abstract": "Incorporating fairness constructs into machine learning algorithms is a topic of much societal importance and recent interest. Clustering, a fundamental task in unsupervised learning that manifests across a number of web data scenarios, has also been subject of attention within fair ML research. In this paper, we develop a novel notion of fairness in clustering, called representativity fairness. Representativity fairness is motivated by the need to alleviate disparity across objects\u2019 proximity to their assigned cluster representatives, to aid fairer decision making. We illustrate the importance of representativity fairness in real-world decision making scenarios involving clustering and provide ways of quantifying objects\u2019 representativity and fairness over it. We develop a new clustering formulation, RFKM, that targets to optimize for representativity fairness along with clustering quality. Inspired by the K-Means framework, RFKM incorporates novel loss terms to formulate an objective function. The RFKM objective and optimization approach guides it towards clustering configurations that yield higher representativity fairness. Through an empirical evaluation over a variety of public datasets, we establish the effectiveness of our method. We illustrate that we are able to significantly improve representativity fairness at only marginal impact to clustering quality.",

Thus, it is imperative to ensure that these algorithms are fair\u2013 even if the dataset contains biases against certain protected groups, the cluster outputs generated should not discriminate against samples from any of these groups. However, recent work in clustering fairness has mostly focused on center-based clustering algorithms, such as k-median and k-means clustering. In this paper, we propose fair algorithms for performing HAC that enforce fairness constraints 1) irrespective of the distance linkage criteria used, 2) generalize to any natural measures of clustering fairness for HAC, 3) work for multiple protected groups, and 4) have competitive running times to vanilla HAC. Through extensive experiments on multiple real-world UCI datasets, we show that our proposed algorithm finds fairer clusterings compared to vanilla HAC as well as the only other state-of-the-art fair HAC approach.",

We define a fairlet decomposition with cost similar to the $k$-median cost and this allows us to obtain approximation algorithms for a wide range of fairness constraints. \nWe complement our theoretical results with an in-depth analysis of our algorithms on real graphs where we show that fair solutions to correlation clustering can be obtained with limited increase in cost compared to the state-of-the-art (unfair) algorithms.",

We empirically evaluate our approach, wherein we quantify both the quality and fairness of clusters, over real-world datasets.

VFC is capable of handling large 4 datasets and offers a mechanism that allows for a trade-off between fairness and clustering quality. We run a series of 5 experiments to evaluate the major claims made by the authors. Specifically, that VFC is on par with SOTA clustering 6 objectives, that it is scalable, that it has a trade-off control, and that it is compatible with both prototype-based and 7 graph-based clustering algorithms. 8",

                "abstract": "Clustering algorithms are a class of unsupervised machine learning (ML) algorithms that feature ubiquitously in modern data science, and play a key role in many learning-based application pipelines. Recently, research in the ML community has pivoted to analyzing the fairness of learning models, including clustering algorithms. Furthermore, research on fair clustering varies widely depending on the choice of clustering algorithm, fairness definitions employed, and other assumptions made regarding models. Despite this, a comprehensive survey of the field does not exist. In this paper, we seek to bridge this gap by categorizing existing research on fair clustering, and discussing possible avenues for future work. Through this survey, we aim to provide researchers with an organized overview of the field, and motivate new and unexplored lines of research regarding fairness in clustering.",

                "abstract": "We revisit the problem of fair clustering, first introduced by Chierichetti et al. (2017) , that requires each protected attribute to have approximately equal representation in every cluster; i.e., a Balance property. Existing solutions to fair clustering are either not scalable or do not achieve an optimal trade-off between clustering objective and fairness. In this paper, we propose a new notion of fairness, which we call \u03c4 -ratio fairness, that strictly generalizes the Balance property and enables a finegrained efficiency vs. fairness trade-off. Furthermore, we show that simple greedy round-robin based algorithms achieve this trade-off efficiently. Under a more general setting of multi-valued protected attributes, we rigorously analyze the theoretical properties of the our algorithms. Our experimental results suggest that the proposed solution outperforms all the state-of-the-art algorithms and works exceptionally well even for a large number of clusters.",
