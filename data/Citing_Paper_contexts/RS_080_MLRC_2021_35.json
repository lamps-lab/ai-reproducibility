                "abstract": "Fourier phase retrieval(PR) is a severely ill-posed inverse problem that arises in various applications. To guarantee a unique solution and relieve the dependence on the initialization, background information can be exploited as a structural priors. However, the requirement for the background information may be challenging when moving to the high-resolution imaging. At the same time, the previously proposed projected gradient descent(PGD) method also demands much background information. In this paper, we present an improved theoretical result about the demand for the background information, along with two Douglas Rachford(DR) based methods. Analytically, we demonstrate that the background required to ensure a unique solution can be decreased by nearly $1/2$ for the 2-D signals compared to the 1-D signals. By generalizing the results into $d$-dimension, we show that the length of the background information more than $(2^{\\frac{d+1}{d}}-1)$ folds of the signal is sufficient to ensure the uniqueness. At the same time, we also analyze the stability and robustness of the model when measurements and background information are corrupted by the noise. Furthermore, two methods called Background Douglas-Rachford (BDR) and Convex Background Douglas-Rachford (CBDR) are proposed. BDR which is a kind of non-convex method is proven to have the local R-linear convergence rate under mild assumptions. Instead, CBDR method uses the techniques of convexification and can be proven to own a global convergence guarantee as long as the background information is sufficient. To support this, a new property called F-RIP is established. We test the performance of the proposed methods through simulations as well as real experimental measurements, and demonstrate that they achieve a higher recovery rate with less background information compared to the PGD method.",

                "abstract": "Fourier phase retrieval (FPR) is a challenging task widely used in various applications. It involves recovering an unknown signal from its Fourier phaseless measurements. FPR with few measurements is important for reducing time and hardware costs, but it suffers from serious ill-posedness. Recently, untrained neural networks have offered new approaches by introducing learned priors to alleviate the ill-posedness without requiring any external data. However, they may not be ideal for reconstructing fine details in images and can be computationally expensive. This paper proposes an untrained neural network (NN) embedded algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework to solve FPR with few measurements. Specifically, we use a generative network to represent the image to be recovered, which confines the image to the space defined by the network structure. To improve the ability to represent high-frequency information, total variation (TV) regularization is imposed to facilitate the recovery of local structures in the image. Furthermore, to reduce the computational cost mainly caused by the parameter updates of the untrained NN, we develop an accelerated algorithm that adaptively trades off between explicit and implicit regularization. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing untrained NN-based algorithms with fewer computational resources and even performs competitively against trained NN-based algorithms.",

Specifically, a teacher model is trained using a self-expressive loss with noise resistance, while a student model is trained with a consistency loss on augmented data to exploit the teacher's dark knowledge. Additionally, we develop an enhanced unfolding network for both the teacher and student models. Extensive experiments show that our proposed approach outperforms existing unsupervised PR methods with higher computational efficiency and performs competitively against supervised methods.",

Traditional restoration algorithms typically aim to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) between the original and recovered images. This often leads to blurry outcomes with poor perceptual quality. Recently, deep diffusion models (DDMs) have proven to be highly capable of sampling images from the a-posteriori probability of the sought variables, resulting in visually pleasing high-quality images. These models have mostly been suggested for real-valued images suffering from Gaussian noise. In this study, we generalize annealed Langevin Dynamics, a type of DDM, to tackle the fundamental challenges in optical imaging of complex-valued objects (and real images) affected by Poisson noise. We apply our algorithm to various optical scenarios, such as Fourier Ptychography, Phase Retrieval, and Poisson denoising. Our algorithm is evaluated on simulations and biological empirical data.",

We use an alternating minimization-based phase retrieval method with a fixed number of iterations as the iterative method. We represent the iterative phase retrieval method as an unrolled network with a fixed number of layers where each layer of the network corresponds to a single step of iteration, and we minimize the recovery error by optimizing over the illumination patterns. Since the number of iterations/layers is fixed, the recovery has a fixed computational cost. Extensive experimental results on a variety of datasets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the quality of image reconstruction at a fixed computational cost with illumination patterns learned only using a small number of training images.",

                "abstract": "Phase retrieval is the problem of reconstructing images from magnitude-only measurements. In many real-world applications the problem is underdetermined. When training data is available, generative models allow optimization in a lower-dimensional latent space, hereby constraining the solution set to those images that can be synthesized by the generative model. However, not all possible solutions are within the range of the generator. Instead, they are represented with some error. To reduce this representation error in the context of phase retrieval, we first leverage a novel variation of intermediate layer optimization (ILO) to extend the range of the generator while still producing images consistent with the training data. Second, we introduce new initialization schemes that further improve the quality of the reconstruction. With extensive experiments on the Fourier phase retrieval problem and thorough ablation studies, we can show the benefits of our modified ILO and the new initialization schemes. Additionally, we analyze the performance of our approach on the Gaussian phase retrieval problem.",

Our method introduces a new targeting scheme and a new loss function. While the targeting scheme accounts for defocused parts of the scene at each depth plane, the new loss function analyzes focused and defocused parts separately in reconstructed images. Our method support phase-only CGH calculations using various iterative (e.g., Gerchberg-Saxton, Gradient Descent) and non-iterative (e.g., Double Phase) CGH techniques. We achieve our best image quality using a modified gradient descent-based optimization recipe where we introduce a constraint inspired by the double phase method. We validate our method experimentally using our proof-of-concept holographic display, comparing various algorithms, including multi-depth scenes with sparse and dense contents.",

In this paper, we formulate affine phase retrieval as an optimization problem and develop a second-order algorithm based on Newton method to solve it. Besides being able to convert into a phase retrieval problem, affine phase retrieval has its unique advantages in its solution. For example, the linear information in the observation makes it possible to solve this problem with second-order algorithms under complex measurements. Another advantage is that our algorithm doesn't have any special requirements for the initial point, while an appropriate initial value is essential for most non-convex phase retrieval algorithms. Starting from zero, our algorithm generates iteration point by Newton method, and we prove that the algorithm can quadratically converge to the true signal without any ambiguity for both Gaussian measurements and CDP measurements. In addition, we also use some numerical simulations to verify the conclusions and to show the effectiveness of the algorithm.",

In this paper, we present a framework to optimize the sensing parameters to improve the quality of the signal recovered by the given iterative method. In particular, we learn illumination patterns to recover signals from coded diffraction patterns using a fixed-cost alternating minimization-based phase retrieval method. Coded diffraction phase retrieval is a physically realistic system in which the signal is first modulated by a sequence of codes before the sensor records its Fourier amplitude. We represent the phase retrieval method as an unrolled network with a fixed number of layers and minimize the recovery error by optimizing over the measurement parameters. Since the number of iterations/layers are fixed, the recovery runs under a fixed cost. We present extensive simulation results on a variety of datasets under different conditions and a comparison with existing methods. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method provides near-perfect reconstruction using patterns learned with a small number of training images. Our proposed method provides significant improvements over existing methods both in terms of accuracy and speed.",

                "abstract": "Background foreground separation (BFS) is a popular computer vision problem where dynamic foreground objects are separated from the static background of a scene. Typically, this is performed using consumer cameras because of their low cost, human interpretability, and high resolution. Yet, cameras and the BFS algorithms that process their data have common failure modes due to lighting changes, highly reflective surfaces, and occlusion. One solution is to incorporate an additional sensor modality that provides robustness to such failure modes. In this paper, we explore the ability of a cost-effective radar system to augment the popular Robust PCA technique for BFS. We apply the emerging technique of algorithm unrolling to yield real-time computation, feedforward inference, and strong generalization in comparison with traditional deep learning methods. We benchmark on the RaDICaL dataset to demonstrate both quantitative improvements of incorporating radar data and qualitative improvements that confirm robustness to common failure modes of image-based methods.",

The network architecture uses a recurrent structure that unrolls the Wirtinger Flow (WF) algorithm with a deep decoding prior that enables performing the algorithm updates in a lower dimensional encoded image space. We use a separate deep network (DN), referred to as the encoding network, for transforming the spectral initialization used in the WF algorithm to an appropriate initial value for the encoded domain. The unrolling scheme models a fixed number of iterations of the underlying optimization algorithm into a recurrent neural network (RNN). Furthermore, it facilitates simultaneous learning of the parameters of the decoding and encoding networks and the RNN. We establish a sufficient condition to guarantee exact recovery under deterministic forward models. Additionally, we demonstrate the relation between the Lipschitz constants of the trained decoding prior and encoding networks to the convergence rate of the WF algorithm. We show the practical applicability of our method in synthetic aperture imaging using high fidelity simulation data from the PCSWAT software. Our numerical study shows that the decoding prior and the encoding network facilitate improvements in sample complexity.",

                "abstract": "Phase retrieval from intensity-only measurements plays a central role in many real-world imaging tasks. In recent years, deep neural networks based methods emerge and show promising performance for phase retrieval. However, their interpretability and generalization still remain a major challenge. In this paper, we propose to combine the advantages of both model-based alternative projection method and deep neural network for phase retrieval, so as to achieve network interpretability and inference effectiveness simultaneously. Specifically, we unfold the iterative process of the alternative projection phase retrieval into a feed-forward neural network, whose layers mimic the processing flow. The physical model of the imaging process is then naturally embedded into the neural network structure. Moreover, a complex-valued U-Net is proposed for defining image priori for forward and backward projection in dual planes. Finally, we designate physics-based formulation as an untrained deep neural network, whose weights are enforced to fit to the given intensity measurements. In summary, our scheme for phase retrieval is effective, interpretable, physics-based and unsupervised. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared with the state-of-the-arts in a practical phase retrieval application\u2014lensless microscopy imaging.",

                "abstract": "Phase retrieval (PR) is an important component in modern computational imaging systems. Recent advances in deep learning have introduced new possibilities for a robust and fast PR. An emerging technique called deep unfolding provides a systematic connection between conventional model-based iterative algorithms and modern data-based deep learning. Unfolded algorithms, which are powered by data learning, have shown remarkable performance and convergence speed improvement over original algorithms. Despite their potential, most existing unfolded algorithms are strictly confined to a fixed number of iterations when layer-dependent parameters are used. In this study, we develop a novel framework for deep unfolding to overcome existing limitations. Our development is based on an unfolded generalized expectation consistent signal recovery (GEC-SR) algorithm, wherein damping factors are left for data-driven learning. In particular, we introduce a hypernetwork to generate the damping factors for GEC-SR. Instead of learning a set of optimal damping factors directly, the hypernetwork learns how to generate the optimal damping factors according to the clinical settings, thereby ensuring its adaptivity to different scenarios. To enable the hypernetwork to adapt to varying layer numbers, we use a recurrent architecture to develop a dynamic hypernetwork that generates a damping factor that can vary online across layers. We also exploit a self-attention mechanism to enhance the robustness of the hypernetwork. Extensive experiments show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing ones in terms of convergence speed and accuracy and still works well under very harsh settings, even under which many classical PR algorithms are unstable.",

                "abstract": "Fourier phase retrieval is a classical problem of restoring a signal only from the measured magnitude of its Fourier transform. Although Fienup-type algorithms, which use prior knowledge in both spatial and Fourier domains, have been widely used in practice, they can often stall in local minima. Convex relaxation methods such as PhaseLift and PhaseCut may offer performance guarantees, but these algorithms are usually computationally expensive for practical use. To address this problem, here we propose a novel unsupervised feed-forward neural network for Fourier phase retrieval which generates high quality reconstruction immediately. Unlike the existing deep learning approaches that use a neural network as a regularization term or an end-to-end blackbox model for supervised training, our algorithm is a feed-forward neural network implementation of physics-driven constraints in an unsupervised learning framework. Specifically, our network is composed of two generators: one for the phase estimation using PhaseCut loss, followed by another generator for image reconstruction, all of which are trained simultaneously without matched data. The link to the classical Fienup-type algorithms and the recent symmetry-breaking learning approach is also revealed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms all existing approaches in Fourier phase retrieval problems.",

                "abstract": "Phase retrieval (PR) is about reconstructing a signal from the magnitude of a number of its complex-valued linear measurements. Recent rapid progress has been made on the development of neural network (NN) based methods for PR. Most of these methods employ pre-trained NNs for modeling target signals, and they require collecting large-scale datasets with ground-truth signals for pre-training, which can be very challenging in many scenarios. There are a few unsupervised learning methods employing untrained NN priors for PR which avoid using external datasets; however, their performance is unsatisfactory compared to pre-trained-NN-based methods. This paper proposes an unsupervised learning method for PR which does not rely on pre-trained NNs while providing state-of-the-art performance. The proposed method trains a randomly-initialized generative NN for signal reconstruction directly on the magnitude measurements of a target signal, which approximates the minimum mean squared error estimator via dropout-based model averaging. Such a model-averaging-based approach provides a better internal prior for the target signal than existing untrained-NN-based methods. The experiments on image reconstruction demonstrate both the advantage of our method over existing unsupervised methods and its competitive performance to pre-trained-NN-based methods.",

However, imaging sensors measure only real-valued non-negative intensities. This results in a nonlinear relation between the measurements and the unknown imaged objects. Moreover, the sensor readouts are corrupted by Poissonian-distributed photon noise. In this work, we seek the most probable object (or clear image), given noisy measurements, that is, maximizing the a-posteriori probability of the sought variables. Hence, we generalize annealed Langevin dynamics, tack-ling fundamental challenges in optical imaging, including phase recovery and Poisson (photon) denoising. We leverage deep neural networks, not for explicit recovery of the imaged object, but as an approximate gradient for a prior term. We show results on empirical data, acquired by a real experiment. We further show results of simulations. 1",
