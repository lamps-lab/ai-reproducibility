                "abstract": "Concerns about reproducibility in artificial intelligence (AI) have emerged, as researchers have reported unsuccessful attempts to directly reproduce published findings in the field. Replicability, the ability to affirm a finding using the same procedures on new data, has not been well studied. In this paper, we examine both reproducibility and replicability of a corpus of 16 papers on table structure recognition (TSR), an AI task aimed at identifying cell locations of tables in digital documents. We attempt to reproduce published results using codes and datasets provided by the original authors. We then examine replicability using a dataset similar to the original as well as a new dataset, GenTSR, consisting of 386 annotated tables extracted from scientific papers. Out of 16 papers studied, we reproduce results consistent with the original in only four. Two of the four papers are identified as replicable using the similar dataset under certain IoU values. No paper is identified as replicable using the new dataset. We offer observations on the causes of irreproducibility and irreplicability. All code and data are available on Codeocean at https://codeocean.com/capsule/6680116/tree.",

                "abstract": "Tables are everywhere, from scientific journals, papers, websites, and newspapers all the way to items we buy at the supermarket. Detecting them is thus of utmost importance to automatically understanding the content of a document. The performance of table detection has substantially increased thanks to the rapid development of deep learning networks. The goals of this survey are to provide a profound comprehension of the major developments in the field of Table Detection, offer insight into the different methodologies, and provide a systematic taxonomy of the different approaches. Furthermore, we provide an analysis of both classic and new applications in the field. Lastly, the datasets and source code of the existing models are organized to provide the reader with a compass on this vast literature. Finally, we go over the architecture of utilizing various object detection and table structure recognition methods to create an effective and efficient system, as well as a set of development trends to keep up with state-of-the-art algorithms and future research. We have also set up a public GitHub repository where we will be updating the most recent publications, open data, and source code.
