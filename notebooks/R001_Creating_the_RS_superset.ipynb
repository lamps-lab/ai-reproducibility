Arbitrary Style Transfer (AST) and Domain Generalization (DG) are the common\\ntasks in the literature where feature distribution matching can be considered as the so‐\\nlution. For example, in AST, the style information of input and target images can be\\ninterpreted as feature distributions and style can be transferred by cross‐distribution\\nfeature matching [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The first drawback in the previous studies is to\\nuse only the mean and standard deviation to match the feature distributions, which\\nmainly relies on the assumption of that the feature distributions follow Gaussian. In\\nreal‐world scenarios, the feature distributions are often much more complicated than\\nGaussian, thus mean and standard deviation may not be fully representative to exactly\\nmatch them. Secondly, although Exact Feature Distribution Matching (EFDM) can be\\nachieved by directly matching the higher‐order statistics of the image features, it is not\\npractical for the current application areas due to the intensive computational overhead.\\nThis paper [1] proposes to perform EFDM in a more effective way by exactly matching the\\nempirical Cumulative Distribution Functions (eCDFs) of image features. As mentioned\\nin the paper, Glivenko–Cantelli theorem [11] states that the empirical Cumulative Distri‐\\nbution Function (eCDF) asymptotically converges to the Cumulative Distribution Func‐\\ntion (CDF) when the number of samples approaches infinity. Relying on this theorem,\\nthis study demonstrates that the feature distributions (i.e., mean, standard deviation,\\nand higher‐order statistics) can be exactly matched by using eCDFs. The authors claim\\nthat this can be achieved by employing a custom Exact Histogram Matching algorithm\\nthat implements Sort‐Matching [12].\\nIn this reproducibility report, we studied EFDM via the Sort‐Matching algorithm on two\\ntasks related to feature distribution matching. In this study, we aimed to reproduce the\\nexperiments provided in the original paper on AST and DG, and reported the details and\\nissues we encountered during this process. We have compared the results obtained in\\nour experiments with the ones reported in the original paper. We have also extended the\\nexperiments to observe how much the performance changes when some hyperparame‐\\nters of EFDM or EFDMix are modified. In addition to the experiments in the paper, we\\nhave investigated the EFDM have the capability of forming better style representations\\nin the cases of modeling the subjects as style.\\n'>\n",
